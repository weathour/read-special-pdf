    "abstract": "This paper presents the shared dedicated lane (SDL) strategy, designed to optimize dedicated lane utilization and enhance traffic flow in mixed environments with connected automated trucks (CATs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The strategy consists of two components: the Platoon Optimal Formation (POF) model, which minimizes fuel consumption for CATs by determining the most efficient platoon formations, and the Two-Lane Cellular Automaton (TCA) model, which simulates vehicle movements, introduces lane-changing rules, and establishes CAT priority conditions to ensure efficient SDL utilization by HDVs. Numerical experiments were conducted on a multi-lane freeway to evaluate the SDL strategy under various traffic scenarios with different CAT demand ratios. The results show that the SDL strategy outperforms traditional approaches by improving traffic flow, fuel efficiency, and overall performance in mixed conditions. Specifically, it reduces fuel consumption by up to 10% under high CAT demand ratios and alleviates congestion while increasing HDV speeds during low CAT demand ratios.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes a shared dedicated lane (SDL) strategy consisting of two main components: the Platoon Optimal Formation (POF) model for optimizing CAT platoon formations to minimize fuel consumption, and the Two-Lane Cellular Automaton (TCA) model for simulating vehicle movements and lane-changing behaviors. The methodology involves numerical experiments on a multi-lane freeway under various traffic scenarios.",
    "conclusion": "The SDL strategy significantly reduces fuel consumption for CATs across all demand ratios, alleviates congestion, and enhances HDV speeds under low CAT demand ratios. It outperforms traditional dedicated lane strategies by improving both traffic efficiency and sustainability in mixed traffic environments.",
