    "abstract": "To manage the bidirectional asymmetric mixed traffic flow with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles, the study proposes a lane management (LM) model based on the joint policy of CAV dedicated lanes (CDLs), CAV reversible lanes (CRLs), and CAV access strategies (CASs) for non-managed lanes. An analytical model is developed to determine the optimal numbers of CDLs and CRLs and the optimal CASs that maximize overall mixed traffic throughputs, considering four parameters under aggressive, moderate, and conservative CAV technology scenarios. The results show that the LM policy can significantly improve overall throughputs compared with the benchmark policy by deploying optimal CDLs, CRLs, and or CASs under the three scenarios. Moreover, for the LM policy, the overall throughput gradually rises, except for the asymptotical increments with the CAV penetration rate under the conservative scenario and the asymptotical reductions with the directional imbalance percent of traffic demand under the three scenarios.",
    "methodology": "The study develops an analytical LM model to determine the optimal numbers of CDLs and CRLs and the optimal CASs for non-managed lanes, considering traffic demand, directional imbalance percent of traffic demand, CAV market penetration rate, and maximum platoon size under different CAV technology scenarios.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed LM policies significantly improve overall mixed traffic throughputs compared to the no LM policy. The optimal deployment of CDLs, CRLs, and CASs varies with traffic demand, directional imbalance percent, CAV penetration rate, and maximum platoon size under different CAV technology scenarios.",
