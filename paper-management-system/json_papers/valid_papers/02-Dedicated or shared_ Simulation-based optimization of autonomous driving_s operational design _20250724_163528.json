    "abstract": "Operational Design Domain (ODD) refers to the specific condition set under which an autonomous driving system is designed to operate. Currently, ODD deployment primarily focuses on safety factors, such as lighting and road surface conditions. However, the impact of ODD deployment on network efficiency is equally significant. To efficiently optimize ODD deployment in terms of network efficiency, we propose a surrogate model that incorporates multi-user structural information and integrate it into an efficient simulation-based optimization framework. The proposed surrogate model can accurately estimate the complex simulation model and construct a hyperplane containing the efficient descent direction for simulation-based optimization. And we compare two common deployment forms, namely, Dedicated Zone (DZ) and Shared Zone (SZ). The results reveal that DZ and SZ have different deployment tendencies. And DZ facilitates the spatial reallocation of travel demand, effectively alleviating congestion, while SZ reduces the temporal continuity of congestion, thus accelerating traffic flow.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes a surrogate model incorporating multi-user structural information (MUSISM) integrated into a simulation-based optimization framework. It uses a mesoscopic simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) model to evaluate deployment schemes, distinguishing between AVs and HVs in terms of travel and driving behavior. A Growable-Chromosome-based Genetic Algorithm (GCGA) is employed for optimization.",
    "conclusion": "DZ and SZ exhibit different deployment tendencies: DZ is cordon-oriented, reallocating traffic demands spatially to alleviate congestion, while SZ is corridor-oriented, reducing temporal congestion continuity to accelerate traffic flow. DZ is insensitive to construction costs, whereas SZ is highly sensitive. The choice between DZ and SZ depends on AV penetration rates and construction costs.",
