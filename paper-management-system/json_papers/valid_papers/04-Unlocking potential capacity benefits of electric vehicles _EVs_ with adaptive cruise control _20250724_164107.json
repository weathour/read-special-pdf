    "abstract": "Today's mainstream vehicles are partially automated via Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that relies on on-board sensors to automatically adjust speed to maintain a safe following distance. Contrary to expectations for automated vehicles, ACC may reduce capacity at bottlenecks because its delayed response and limited initial acceleration during queue discharge could increase the average headway. Fortunately, EV's unique powertrain characteristics such as instantaneous torque and regenerative braking could allow ACC to adopt shorter headways and accelerate more swiftly to maintain shorter headways during queue discharge, therefore reverse the negative impact on capacity. This has been verified in a series of field experiments, which demonstrate that EVs with ACC could potentially achieve a capacity as high as 2,931 veh/hr/lane in steady-state conditions, and it can be sustained in non-steady-state conditions where speeds fluctuate and queues form.",
    "methodology": "Field experiments were conducted using high-precision GPS to collect trajectory-level car-following data from EVs equipped with ACC. The experiments involved controlled car-following scenarios with varying speeds and ACC gap settings to simulate steady-state and non-steady-state traffic conditions.",
    "conclusion": "Field experiments demonstrate that ACC-equipped EVs can achieve shorter headways (as low as 1.23 s) and higher capacities (up to 2,931 veh/hr/lane) compared to ICE vehicles with ACC. The unique powertrain characteristics of EVs, such as instantaneous torque and regenerative braking, enable sustained shorter headways even in non-steady-state conditions, improving traffic flow stability and capacity.",
