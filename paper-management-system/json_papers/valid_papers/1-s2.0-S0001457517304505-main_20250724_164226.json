    "abstract": "Connected vehicles (CV) technology has recently drawn an increasing attention from governments, vehicle manufacturers, and researchers. One of the biggest issues facing CVs popularization associates it with the market penetration rate (MPR). The full market penetration of CVs might not be accomplished recently. Therefore, traffic flow will likely be composed of a mixture of conventional vehicles and CVs. In this context, the study of CV MPR is worthwhile in the CV transition period. The overarching goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal safety of CV platoons by comparing the implementation of managed-lane CV platoons and all lanes CV platoons (with same MPR) over non-CV scenario. This study applied the CV concept on a congested expressway (SR408) in Florida to improve traffic safety. The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) along with the platooning concept were used to regulate the driving behavior of CV platoons with an assumption that the CVs would follow this behavior in real-world. A high-level control algorithm of CVs in a managed-lane was proposed in order to form platoons with three joining strategies: rear join, front join, and cut-in joint. Five surrogate safety measures, standard deviation of speed, time exposed time-to-collision (TET), time integrated time-to-collision (TIT), time exposed rear-end crash risk index (TERCRI), and sideswipe crash risk (SSCR) were utilized as indicators for safety evaluation. The results showed that both CV approaches (i.e., managed-lane CV platoons, and all lanes CV platoons) significantly improved the longitudinal safety in the studied expressway compared to the non-CV scenario. In terms of surrogate safety measures, the managed-lane CV platoons significantly outperformed all lanes CV platoons with the same MPR. Different time-to-collision (TTC) thresholds were also tested and showed similar results on traffic safety. Results of this study provide useful insight for the management of CV MPR as managed-lane CV platoons.",
