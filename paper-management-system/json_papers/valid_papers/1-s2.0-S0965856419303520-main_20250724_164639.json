    "abstract": "Traffic simulation is a cost-effective way to test the deployment of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles in a large-scale transportation network. By using a previously developed microscopic simulation testbed, this paper examines the impacts of four managed lane strategies for the near-term deployment of CACC vehicles under mixed traffic conditions. Network-wide performance measures are investigated from the perspectives of mobility, safety, equity, and environmental impacts. In addition, the platoon formation performance of CACC vehicles is evaluated with platoon-orientated measures, such as the percentage of platooned CACC vehicles, average platoon depth, and vehicle-hour-platooned that is proposed in this paper under the imperfect DSRC communication environment. Moreover, managed lane score matrices are developed to incorporate heterogeneous categories of performance measures, aiming to provide a more comprehensive picture for stakeholders. The results show that mixing CACC traffic along with non-CACC traffic across all travel lanes is an acceptable option when the market penetration (MP) is lower than 30% for roadways where a managed lane is absent. Providing CACC with priority access to an existing managed lane, if available, is also a good strategy for improving the overall traffic performance when the MP is lower than 40%. When the MP reaches above 40%, a dedicated lane for CACC vehicles is recommended, as it provides greater opportunity for CACC vehicles to form platoons. The facilitation of homogeneous CACC traffic flow could make further improvements possible in the future.",
    "methodology": "Microscopic traffic simulation using PTV Vissim, Vissim Component Object Model (COM) interface, and the Vissim DriverModel.DLL application programming interface (VEDM). The simulation framework evaluates four managed lane strategies under mixed traffic conditions.",
    "conclusion": "For locations without existing managed lane policy, mixing CACC traffic across all travel lanes is an acceptable option when the market penetration rate is below 30%. Mixed managed lane (e.g., HOV + CACC, HOT + CACC) is a versatile option for providing priority lane usage for CACC vehicles, especially in the locations where ML strategies have already been implemented. It is premature to implement CACC lane when market penetration (MP) is below 30%, due to the degradation of the traffic condition on the general purpose lanes. When the mid-range MP (30% to 55%) is reached, CACC lane begins to show its advantages for facilitating CACC clustering and forming homogeneous CACC traffic that is ultimately necessary for the further harness of the benefits of CACC (e.g., higher speed limit and short headway intra-platoon car following).",
