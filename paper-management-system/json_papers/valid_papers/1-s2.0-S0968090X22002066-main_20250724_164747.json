    "abstract": "This paper proposes a control strategy for a freeway merging bottleneck consisting of a Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) exclusive lane and a human-driven vehicle (HDV) lane, aiming to achieve fuel economy and increase traffic efficiency. The trajectories of CAVs are optimized to enable them to smoothly merge into the gaps in the HDV lane. We utilize a stochastic car-following model to incorporate the uncertainty of HDVs and adopt the concept of α-percentile trajectory proposed in our earlier work (Xiong and Jiang, 2021) to estimate the trajectories of HDVs. Based on these, an optimization model is constructed to optimize the merging sequence and the merging trajectories of CAVs simultaneously. We use dynamic programming to solve the optimization model. Dividing RECTangles algorithm and Hamiltonian analysis are imbedded as a subroutine to obtain the energy efficient merging trajectory of each CAV. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy is capable of reducing average fuel consumption and travel time under a wide range of inflow rates. The benefits depend on the inflow rate and the trajectory percentile α. When the total inflow rate is low, the impact of α is insignificant. If the total inflow rate increases to a high level, the impact of α becomes remarkable and the maximum benefits would be achieved at an intermediate range of α. Moreover, the computation efficiency of the proposed system is fast enough and can be implemented in real-time in the near future.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes a control strategy using a stochastic car-following model to incorporate the uncertainty of HDVs. It employs the concept of α-percentile trajectory to estimate HDV trajectories and constructs an optimization model to optimize the merging sequence and trajectories of CAVs. Dynamic programming, Dividing RECTangles algorithm, and Hamiltonian analysis are used for solving the optimization model.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed control strategy effectively reduces average fuel consumption and travel time under various inflow rates. The benefits are most significant at intermediate values of α and higher inflow rates. The system's computational efficiency is sufficient for real-time implementation.",
