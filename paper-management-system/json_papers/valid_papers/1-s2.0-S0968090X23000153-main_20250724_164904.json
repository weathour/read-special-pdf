    "abstract": "This paper leverages emerging highway vehicle platooning technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fleeting trains at minimum headways under moving blocks. The research aims to better understand how closely following trains respond to different throttle and brake control algorithms, and, using insights gained from automobile and truck platooning technology, develop improved train control algorithms balancing fuel efficiency and train headway. To do so, a detailed multi-train performance simulator is developed to evaluate following train control algorithms and then adapt highway vehicle platooning control methods to the heavy haul freight rail domain.",
    "methodology": "The research uses simulations to understand the baseline headway and fuel efficiency implications of train operations under moving blocks. A multi-train simulator is developed to evaluate control algorithms, adapting existing approaches to highway vehicle platooning where applicable. Five following train control algorithms under two different communication topologies are formulated.",
    "conclusion": "The simulation results suggest that certain families of control laws are better than others at managing train separation and fuel consumption within train fleets. The results allow industry practitioners to develop improved locomotive driver advisory and semi-autonomous adaptive train cruise control systems for the operation of fleets of trains under moving blocks.",
