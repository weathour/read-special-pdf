    "abstract": "This paper presents a macroscopic fundamental diagram model with volume delay relationship (MFD-VD) for road traffic networks, by exploring two new data sources: license plate cameras (LPCs) and road congestion indices (RCIs). We derive a first-order, nonlinear and implicit ordinary differential equation involving the network accumulation (the volume) and average congestion index (the delay), and use empirical data from a 266 km2 urban network to fit an accumulation-based MFD with 𝑅2 > 0.9. The issue of incomplete traffic volume observed by the LPCs is addressed with a theoretical derivation of the observability-invariant property: The ratio of traffic volume to the critical value (corresponding to the peak of the MFD) is independent of the (unknown) proportion of those detected vehicles. Conditions for such a property to hold are discussed in theory and verified empirically. This offers a practical way to estimate the ratio-to-critical-value, which is an important indicator of network saturation and efficiency, by simply working with a finite set of LPCs.",
    "methodology": "The study derives a first-order, nonlinear and implicit ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the MFD-VD model, using empirical data from license plate cameras (LPCs) and road congestion indices (RCIs). The model is validated with data from a 266 km2 urban network in Chengdu, China. The methodology includes theoretical derivation, empirical fitting, and validation of the observability-invariant property.",
    "conclusion": "The MFD-VD model effectively utilizes LPCs and RCIs to estimate network traffic dynamics without requiring full observability or known detection rates. The ratio-to-critical-value is shown to be invariant to the level of partial observation, providing a practical tool for assessing network saturation and efficiency. The model's robustness is validated across different time granularities and RCI values.",
