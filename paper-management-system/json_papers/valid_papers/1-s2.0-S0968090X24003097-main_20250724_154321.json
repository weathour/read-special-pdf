    "abstract": "The use of Air traffic management (ATM) simulators for planing and operations can be challenging due to their modelling complexity. This paper presents XALM (eXplainable Active Learning Metamodel), a three-step framework integrating active learning and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values into simulation metamodels for supporting ATM decision-making. XALM efficiently uncovers hidden relationships among input and output variables in ATM simulators, which are usually of interest in policy analysis. Our experiments show that XALM s predictive performance is comparable to that of the XGBoost metamodel with fewer simulations. Additionally, XALM exhibits superior explanatory capabilities compared to non-active learning metamodels. Using the  Mercury  (flight and passenger) ATM simulator, XALM is applied to a real- world scenario in Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, extending an arrival manager s range and scope by analysing six variables. This case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing simulation interpretability and understanding variable interactions. By addressing computational challenges and improving explainability, it complements traditional simulation-based analyses. Lastly, we discuss two practical approaches for reducing the computational burden of the metamodelling further: we introduce a stopping criterion for active learning based on the inherent uncertainty of the metamodel, and we show how the simulations used for the metamodel can be reused across key performance indicators, thus decreasing the overall number of simulations needed.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes XALM, a three-step framework integrating active learning, Gaussian processes (GPs), and SHAP values for simulation metamodeling. The methodology involves: 1) Active learning to select informative data points efficiently, 2) Gaussian processes for metamodeling to approximate simulator outputs, and 3) SHAP values for explainability to interpret the relationships between input and output variables.",
    "conclusion": "XALM demonstrates comparable predictive performance to XGBoost with fewer simulations and superior explanatory capabilities. The framework effectively enhances simulation interpretability and understanding of variable interactions in ATM systems. Practical approaches like stopping criteria based on metamodel uncertainty and reusing simulations across KPIs further reduce computational burden.",
