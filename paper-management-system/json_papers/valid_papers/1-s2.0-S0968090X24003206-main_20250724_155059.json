    "abstract": "Car following (CF) models are fundamental to describing traffic dynamics. However, the CF behavior of human drivers is highly stochastic and nonlinear. As a result, identifying the 'best' CF model has been challenging and controversial despite decades of research. Introduction of automated vehicles has further complicated this matter as their CF controllers remain proprietary, though their behavior appears different than human drivers. This paper develops a stochastic learning approach to integrate multiple CF models, rather than relying on a single model. The framework is based on approximate Bayesian computation that probabilistically concatenates a pool of CF models based on their relative likelihood of describing observed behavior. The approach, while data-driven, retains physical tractability and interpretability. Evaluation results using two datasets show that the proposed approach can better reproduce vehicle trajectories for both human-driven and automated vehicles than any single CF model considered.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes a stochastic hybrid car-following model based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). The framework probabilistically concatenates multiple CF models based on their relative likelihood of describing observed behavior. ABC is used to approximate the posterior model parameter distributions through simulations without assuming a specific likelihood function. The approach involves generating particles (parameter sets) for each CF model, evaluating them based on a universal distance function, and accepting particles that generate trajectories within an acceptable distance. The accepted particles are used to approximate the posterior distribution of the hybrid CF model.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed hybrid model based on stochastic learning of ABC addresses the challenges of inherent stochasticity and nonlinearity in car-following behavior. Evaluation using two datasets demonstrated the ability to learn CF behavior while accounting for stochasticity, outperforming traditional CF models. The hybrid model can replicate CF behavior even when the actual CF model or controller is absent from the candidate pool by probabilistically concatenating several models. The framework is generalizable and adaptable to various datasets and different CF model pools, enhancing realism in traffic simulations.",

        "The research addresses the complexity and stochasticity of car-following behavior, which has been a persistent challenge in traffic dynamics.",
