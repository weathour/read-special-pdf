    "abstract": "With the increased deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in mixed traffic flow, ensuring safe and efficient interactions between AVs and human road users is important. In urban environments, intersections have various conflicts that can greatly affect driving safety and traffic efficiency. This study uses road test data to examine the possible safety and efficiency impacts of intersection conflict resolution involving AVs. The contribution comprises two main aspects. Firstly, we prepare and open a high-quality lateral conflict resolution dataset derived from the Argoverse-2 data, specifically targeting urban intersections. A rigorous data processing pipeline is applied to extract pertinent scenarios, rectify anomalies, enhance data quality, and annotate conflict regimes. This effort yields 5000 AV-involved and 16000 AV-free cases, covering rich conflict regimes and balanced traffic states. Secondly, we employ surrogate safety measures to assess the safety impact of AVs on human-driven vehicles (HVs) and pedestrians. In addition, a novel concept of Minimum Recurrent Clearance Time (MRCT) is proposed to quantify the traffic efficiency impacts of AVs during conflict resolution.",
    "methodology": "The study uses a data processing pipeline to extract, enhance, and annotate conflict resolution scenarios from the Argoverse-2 dataset. Surrogate safety measures (SSMs) and the novel MRCT concept are employed to assess safety and efficiency impacts.",
    "conclusion": "The results show that, for AV-HV and HV-HV conflict resolution processes, the differences in selected safety and efficiency measures for human drivers are statistically insignificant. In contrast, pedestrians demonstrate diverse behaviour adjustments. Some pedestrians behave more conservatively when interacting with AVs than with HVs. Notably, the efficiency of AV-involved conflict resolution is significantly lower than in AV-free instances due to the conservative driving style of AVs.",
