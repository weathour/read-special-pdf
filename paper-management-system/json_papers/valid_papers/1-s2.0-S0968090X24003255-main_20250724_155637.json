    "abstract": "In urban traffic management, the primary challenge of dynamically and efficiently monitoring traffic conditions is compounded by the insufficient utilization of thousands of surveillance cameras along the intelligent transportation system. This paper introduces the multi-level Traffic-responsive Tilt Camera surveillance system (TTC-X), a novel framework designed for dynamic and efficient monitoring and management of traffic in urban networks. By leveraging widely deployed pan tilt-cameras (PTCs), TTC-X overcomes the limitations of a fixed field of view in traditional surveillance systems by providing mobilized and 360-degree coverage. The innovation of TTC-X lies in the integration of advanced machine learning modules, including a detector predictor controller structure, with a novel Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) methodology and the Spatial Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP) for real-time traffic estimation and PTC control. The TTC-X is tested and evaluated under three experimental scenarios (e.g., maximum traffic flow capture, dynamic route planning, traffic state estimation) based on a simulation environment calibrated using real-world traffic data in Brooklyn, New York. The experimental results showed that TTC-X captured over 60% total number of vehicles at the network level, dynamically adjusted its route recommendation in reaction to unexpected full-lane closure events, and reconstructed link-level traffic states with best MAE less than 1.25 vehicle hour. Demonstrating scalability, cost-efficiency, and adaptability, TTC-X emerges as a powerful solution for urban traffic management in both cyber physical and real-world environments.",
    "methodology": "The TTC-X framework integrates a detector-predictor-controller (DPC) structure with Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) and Spatial Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP). The detector uses YOLOv8 for object detection and StrongSORT for tracking. The predictor (STGP) employs graph convolution networks and transformers for traffic state forecasting. The controller (PiCOL) uses an online learning algorithm for real-time PTC tilting control.",
    "conclusion": "TTC-X demonstrated significant improvements in capturing vehicles, adjusting optimal routes during incidents, and reconstructing traffic states. It showed cost-effectiveness, rapid responsiveness to variant traffic situations, and accurate capture of traffic states, showcasing its potential for effective traffic management in diverse urban settings.",
