    "abstract": "The real-time crash likelihood prediction model is an essential component of the proactive traffic safety management system. Over the years, numerous studies have attempted to construct a crash likelihood prediction model in order to enhance traffic safety, but mostly on freeways. In the majority of the existing studies, researchers have primarily used a deep learning-based framework to identify crash potential. Lately, Transformers have emerged as a potential deep neural network that fundamentally operates through attention-based mechanisms. Transformers exhibit distinct functional benefits over established deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). First, they employ attention mechanisms to accurately weigh the significance of different parts of input data, a dynamic functionality that is not available in RNNs, LSTMs, and CNNs. Second, they are well-equipped to handle dependencies over long-range data sequences, a feat RNNs typically struggle with. Lastly, unlike RNNs, LSTMs, and CNNs, which process data in sequence, Transformers can parallelly process data elements during training and inference, thereby enhancing their efficiency.",
    "methodology": "The study proposes inTersection-Transformer (inTformer), a time-embedded attention-based Transformer model that predicts intersection crash likelihood in real-time. The model uses connected vehicle data and divides the intersection into two zones: within-intersection and approach zones, each representing unique traffic flow patterns.",
    "conclusion": "The inTformer models achieved a sensitivity of up to 73% in the within-intersection zone and 74% in the approach zone. Benchmarking against earlier studies and established deep learning models confirmed the superiority of the proposed inTformer. The SHAP method identified critical predictors such as average and maximum approach speeds, control delays, travel times, split failure percentage and count, and percent arrival on green.",
