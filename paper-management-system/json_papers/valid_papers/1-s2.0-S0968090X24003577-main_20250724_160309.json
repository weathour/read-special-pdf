    "abstract": "Data provided by floating vehicles have the same limitation as that provided by an imperfect stationary detector that undercounts vehicles: they provide data from an unknown proportion of the total flow. Since the knowledge of this proportion is critical for some applications, its value is usually estimated by complementing with data provided by other monitoring infrastructure. However, this type of infrastructure is not the norm in many cities, particularly in developing countries. This paper extends a previously proposed method to estimate this penetration solely from a series of inter-detection times. The improved method is based on Bayesian inference and supports a series of passage times coming from multilane infrastructure, albeit still requiring an uninterrupted traffic regime. The method was applied to actual RFID interdetection times from a four-lane weaving urban freeway segment in Santiago, Chile. The resulting estimated rates are consistent with those reported by the freeway operator, showing the method s capabilities.",

    "conclusion": "The method proposed is key in taking full advantage of the data provided by technology already in place in many cities, such as Bluetooth WiFi scanners and or RFID transponders. Unlike other studies found in the literature that use the total number of vehicles passing at some locations, the method only uses information regarding the time elapsed between consecutive detections. This is a distinguishing and essential feature of the method since most places   particularly in developing countries   are insufficiently (or not-at-all) equipped with stationary traffic sensors.",
