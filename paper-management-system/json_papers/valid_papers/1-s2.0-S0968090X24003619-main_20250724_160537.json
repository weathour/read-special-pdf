    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new methodology for measuring street-level pedestrian density that combines the strengths of image-based observations with the scalability of drive-by sensing. Despite its importance, existing methods for measuring pedestrian activity have several limitations, including high costs, limited coverage, and privacy concerns. To overcome these issues, our approach exploits operation logs generated by dashboard cameras of moving vehicles to estimate pedestrian density for each street, which is validated with data from approximately 3,000 taxis operating in central Tokyo. We produce vibrancy maps for 292 station areas in central Tokyo by leveraging machine learning to estimate pedestrian density in streets where measurement data is scarce. We also evaluate the reliability and coverage of the measurement and illustrate how the measured pedestrian density data can be utilized for assessing the validity of walkability measures. The paper concludes that this approach could provide valuable data to inform urban planning and city operations.",
    "methodology": "The study combines image-based observations from dashboard cameras with machine learning techniques to estimate pedestrian density. Data from approximately 3,000 taxis in central Tokyo was used, with pedestrian counts derived from object detection models running on dashcam processors. The methodology includes spatial and temporal segmentation, pedestrian counting, mapping, aggregation, and machine learning-based prediction for under-sampled areas.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed method effectively estimates pedestrian density at street level with an error of about 20% using three samples per segment. It demonstrates strong correlations with existing walkability measures, validating its utility for urban planning. The approach is scalable and leverages existing vehicle networks, though it has limitations in highly congested areas due to occlusion issues.",
