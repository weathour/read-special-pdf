    "abstract": "Given the aging highway infrastructure requiring extensive rebuilding and enhancements, and the consequent rise in the number of work zones, there is an urgent need to develop advanced safety systems to protect workers. While Augmented Reality (AR) holds significant potential for delivering warnings to workers, its integration into roadway work zones remains relatively unexplored. The primary objective of this study is to improve safety measures within roadway work zones by conducting an extensive analysis of how different combinations of multimodal Augmented Reality (AR) warnings influence the reaction times of workers. This paper addresses this gap through a series of experiments that aim to replicate the distinctive conditions of roadway work zones, both in real-world and virtual reality environments. Our approach comprises three key components: an advanced AR system prototype, a VR simulation of AR functionality within the work zone environment, and the Wizard of Oz technique to synchronize user experiences across experiments. To assess reaction times, we leverage both the simple reaction time (SRT) technique and an innovative vision-based metric that utilizes real-time pose estimation.",
    "methodology": "The study employed a multifaceted approach to measure reaction times in distinctive setups to gauge different aspects of reaction time and to evaluate the efficacy of various sensory modes of warning deliveries as measured by reaction time. The methodology leveraged two distinct mechanisms to quantify reaction time: a Simple Reaction Time (SRT) approach and a novel vision-based approach. The study involved five experiments conducted in both outdoor controlled work zone and indoor VR settings, enabling extensive data capture on multimodal AR warnings' performance.",
    "conclusion": "The findings indicate that the haptic visual warning triggered the fastest response on average among the participants and produced measurements comparable to those of the audio haptic visual warning. Moreover, both of these warnings significantly outperformed visual and audio visual warnings in terms of reaction time. The study also revealed that VR-simulated warnings were not significantly shorter than AR warnings in the real world, emphasizing the importance of accounting for real-world performance when designing AR-oriented safety solutions. The proposed vision-based reaction time measurement approach demonstrated statistical comparability with SRT-based metrics, offering potential for wider applications in systematically assessing and monitoring worker performance.",
