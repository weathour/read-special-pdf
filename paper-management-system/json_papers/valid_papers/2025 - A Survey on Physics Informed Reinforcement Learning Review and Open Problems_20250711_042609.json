    "abstract": "The inclusion of physical information in machine learning frameworks has revolutionized many application areas. This work explores the utility of physical constraints and laws for reinforcement learning (RL) applications, presenting a thorough review of Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL). A novel taxonomy classifies existing works based on the RL pipeline, physics representation forms, and integration methods. The survey analyzes learning architectures, physics biases, applications across domains, and identifies unresolved challenges for enhancing RL's physical plausibility, precision, data efficiency, and real-world applicability.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and taxonomy development. Works are classified using a three-tiered taxonomy: (1) Physics information types (e.g., differential equations, barrier certificates, simulators), (2) PIRL methods (state design, action regulation, reward augmentation), and (3) RL pipeline stages. Additional categorization includes learning architectures (e.g., safety filters, residual learning) and physics biases (observational, learning, inductive).",
    "conclusion": "PIRL significantly enhances RL algorithms by integrating physical knowledge, improving sample efficiency, safety, and real-world applicability. Key contributions include a unified taxonomy, algorithmic review, benchmark analysis, and identification of open challenges such as high-dimensional spaces, safety in uncertain environments, and standardized evaluation frameworks.",

      "Overview": "This survey reviews the integration of physics priors into reinforcement learning (PIRL), addressing challenges like sample inefficiency and safety. It introduces a taxonomy categorizing physics representations, integration methods, and RL pipeline stages, while analyzing applications in robotics, control systems, and optimization.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "RL struggles with real-world deployment due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and sim-to-real gaps. Physical systems' complexities are often misaligned with purely data-driven RL approaches.",
        "Motivation stems from leveraging physics to improve RL's data efficiency, safety, and generalization. Specific problems include high-dimensional state spaces, unsafe exploration, and under-defined rewards in physical systems.",
        "Authors argue physics priors are essential for RL to handle partially observed, uncertain environments. They highlight the urgency through real-world application failures and exponential growth in PIRL publications.",
        "The problem connects to broader ML challenges: bridging simulation-reality gaps and ensuring solutions adhere to fundamental physical laws. Significance is established via case studies in autonomous driving, robotics, and energy management.",
