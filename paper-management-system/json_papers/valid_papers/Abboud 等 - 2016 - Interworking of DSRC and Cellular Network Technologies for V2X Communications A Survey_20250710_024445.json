    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications refer to information exchange between a vehicle and various elements of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), including other vehicles, pedestrians, Internet gateways, and transport infrastructure. This paper surveys potential DSRC and cellular interworking solutions for efficient V2X communications. It highlights limitations of each technology, reviews hybrid architectures, discusses interworking challenges from vehicle mobility (vertical handover, network selection), provides an overview of global DSRC standards, R&D platforms, and commercially deployed V2X products, and suggests open research issues.",
    "methodology": "Literature survey and comparative analysis of hybrid DSRC-cellular architectures, mobility management challenges, standardization efforts, and commercial deployments. The methodology involves systematic review of interworking solutions, classification of architectures, and identification of technical gaps.",
    "conclusion": "Interworking between DSRC and cellular technologies is essential for efficient V2X communications due to limitations of standalone solutions. Key challenges include mobility management, vertical handover, and network selection. Future research must address computational complexity, market penetration disparities, and integration with emerging technologies like 5G small cells and software-defined networks.",
