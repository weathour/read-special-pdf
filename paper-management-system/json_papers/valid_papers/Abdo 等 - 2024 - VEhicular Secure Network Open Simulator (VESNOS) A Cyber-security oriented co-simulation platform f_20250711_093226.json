    "abstract": "Connected vehicles are a big part of the automotive industry's overall growth trend that may be utilized to improve transportation safety, expand mobility options, lower expenses, and provide new job possibilities. Thus, a complete examination of connected driving is required before the large-scale implementation in reality, which may be done affordably and efficiently using a reliable simulation platform. Current traffic simulators ease the research and development of connected vehicles by offering incremental enhancements to traditional traffic flow modeling approaches, which cannot replicate the features of real-world connected vehicles. Moreover, current standard security features that are used by the U.S. Department of Transportation or other research entities are not considered. Network-level evaluation incorporating large-scale traffic networks and Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) communications should also be addressed. This study develops a novel and comprehensive co-simulation platform for conventional, connected, and automated driving that tightly integrates the main components of V2X communications, cyber-security protocol, traffic networks, and conventional vehicle models. Three major open-source components, SUMO, OMNeT++, and security credential management system (SCMS) based V2X simulator, are integrated and interconnected via the Traffic Control Interface (TraCI). Case studies show that the proposed platform provides an appropriate and trustworthy testbed for examining the possible social economic effects of connected driving under a security credential management system.",
    "methodology": "Integration of SUMO (traffic microsimulation), OMNeT++ (network simulation), and SCMS (Security Credential Management System) via bidirectional coupling using TraCI (Traffic Control Interface). Client-server deployment model with real-time synchronization of vehicle positions, V2X communications, and security authentication protocols.",
    "conclusion": "VESNOS provides an efficient and trustworthy testbed for evaluating cybersecurity in connected vehicles. It successfully detects man-in-the-middle attacks within 52ms and prevents Sybil attacks in platooning scenarios through SCMS authentication. The platform demonstrates significant improvements in attack detection speed compared to existing frameworks, validating its effectiveness for secure V2X communication analysis.",
