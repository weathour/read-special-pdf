    "abstract": "Security issues are the most critical challenges facing new technologies associated with the internet of things (IoT), big data, and cloud computing. A secure and efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) is crucial to detect security threats. Existing IDSs are known to suffer from many problems, most notably the high rate of false positive alerts, the long time required to detect attacks, and the inability to detect zero-day attacks, which can ruin companies. The weakness of IDS backend engines costs companies time in the investigation process. This paper proposes and enhances IDS detection mechanisms via two processes: using a deep neural network (DNN) model with new features for threat detection based on two assumptions related to handling zero-day attacks, with low computing power and resources, and a comprehensive solution for detection by merging the DNN model and principle component analysis (PCA) to increase security and performance. The proposed detection mechanism combines DNN, PCA, statistical, and knowledge-based approaches to offer significantly greater efficiency than existing IDS, as indicated by analytical and software results. A simulation model is used with up-to-date web attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS), denial of service (DoS), brute force, insider infiltration, Botnet, and Heartbleed attacks. The proposed detection techniques for large networks are analyzed and complexity in the design is avoided by reducing the number of DNN model layers, thus minimizing detection time delay and false positives, while increasing security against network attacks. Integrating the proposed DNN with PCA, an innovative contribution, introduces robust IDS to significantly improve the detection time delay and security performance. The proposed model showed a 98% accuracy rate. To best of our knowledge, the highest accuracy rate stated based on a large number of attacks is 97%, which makes our model state of art.",
    "methodology": "Combines Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, statistical methods for data acquisition, and knowledge-based approaches. Uses the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, preprocessing including normalization and handling missing values, data splitting for training and testing, and evaluation metrics like accuracy and false positive rate.",
    "conclusion": "The hybrid PCA-DNN model achieves 98% accuracy in detecting network anomalies, reduces false positives and detection time, and outperforms existing IDS methods. It effectively handles zero-day attacks with low resource requirements, making it suitable for large-scale networks.",

      "Overview": "The paper proposes a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to detect abnormal network behavior. It addresses challenges in cybersecurity for IoT, big data, and cloud computing by enhancing detection accuracy and reducing false positives and detection time, validated on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The research addresses broader challenges in cybersecurity, such as the proliferation of IoT devices, big data vulnerabilities, and cloud computing risks, where existing IDS solutions fail to detect zero-day attacks and generate high false positives.",
        "Motivation stems from the need to develop an efficient IDS that can detect stealth-based attacks (e.g., zero-day attacks) with minimal computational resources, reduce investigation time for companies, and improve overall network security.",
        "The authors argue for necessity by highlighting the economic and time costs of current IDS weaknesses, emphasizing that undetected attacks can lead to significant data breaches and operational disruptions.",
        "They relate the specific problem to broader challenges by demonstrating how network anomalies compromise data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, establishing significance through real-world attack simulations and dataset validation.",

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: (1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to minimize noise and feature redundancy; (2) Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification of network traffic as normal or malicious; (3) Cyber Threat Intelligence for proactive anomaly detection based on flow-level analysis.",
        "Logical relationships: PCA reduces high-dimensional data to essential features, which are then fed into DNN for supervised learning. This hybrid approach leverages statistical methods for data preprocessing and knowledge-based rules to enhance detection efficiency, creating a pipeline from data collection to classification.",
        "Key assumptions include: Network traffic patterns are statistically distinguishable between normal and malicious activities; flow-level data (e.g., from NetFlow) adequately represents network behavior; and dimensionality reduction does not compromise detection accuracy.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include PCA for feature reduction (selecting 12 key features), DNN with ReLU activation for classification, data preprocessing (standardization, handling missing values), and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, false positive rate, and confusion matrix. The CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset is used for simulation.",
        "Novelty lies in the hybrid PCA-DNN approach, which is applicable to large networks and cloud environments. Rationality is shown through reduced training time and high accuracy; PCA's determinism and compatibility with incomplete data make it preferable over alternatives like t-SNE.",

Preprocessing involves normalization (Z-score), one-hot encoding for categorical labels, and data splitting (80% training, 20% testing) with stratification to handle imbalance. Representativeness is evaluated as high due to real-world attack scenarios.",
        "Experimental design is rigorous, using k-fold cross-validation (k=5), multiple hyperparameter optimizations (e.g., batch size, learning rate), and comparison with state-of-the-art models. Evaluation metrics (accuracy, FPR) are adequate, though dataset limitations like imbalance are acknowledged.",
