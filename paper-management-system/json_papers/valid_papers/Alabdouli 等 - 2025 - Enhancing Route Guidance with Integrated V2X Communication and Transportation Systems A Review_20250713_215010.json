    "abstract": "Due to its anticipated impacts on the performance of transportation systems, intelligent transport systems (ITS) have emerged as one of the most extensively investigated topics. The U.S. Department of Transportation has defined route guidance systems (RGSs) as one of the main categories within ITS. Systems like these are essential components when managing travel and transportation. While RGSs play a pivotal role in both present and future transportation, there has been limited research on evaluating the effectiveness and dependability of integrating them with vehicular communication frameworks. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the RGS architectures proposed to date in the literature, providing comparisons and classifications based on their structures and requirements for communication systems. Moreover, it explores existing, next generation, as well as prospective choices for V2X communication technologies, evaluating how well they contribute to the development of RGS applications by integrating them with potential communication systems. Specifically, this study assesses the suitability of communication technologies in meeting the requirements of RGS applications. In conclusion, it suggests a framework for integrating RGS and V2X systems and offers directions for future research in this area.",

    "conclusion": "The paper concludes that both transportation and communication networks must be integrated for successful dynamic route guidance systems, highlighting the need for in-depth investigation into scalability and robustness. It proposes an integrated framework that shows promise for real-life implementation, potentially leading to more efficient and reliable communication architectures.",

      "Overview": "The paper reviews the integration of route guidance systems (RGS) with V2X communication technologies in intelligent transportation systems, focusing on evaluating existing architectures, classifying them, and proposing a framework for enhanced efficiency and reliability.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The research addresses broader challenges of traffic congestion, increased fuel consumption, air pollution, and inefficient transportation systems in smart cities, exacerbated by traditional solutions like road expansion being costly and unsustainable.",
        "The motivation stems from limited research on the effectiveness and dependability of integrating RGS with vehicular communication frameworks, specifically the impact of communication delays and data packet delivery on providing optimal route solutions.",
        "The authors argue for necessity and urgency by highlighting that most studies assume optimal data transmission, overlooking real-world issues like data loss and latency, which undermines system reliability and efficiency in dynamic environments.",
        "The specific problem of RGS-communication integration is related to broader challenges in ITS by emphasizing that seamless data exchange is critical for real-time traffic management, reducing congestion, and enhancing overall transportation performance in smart cities.",
        "The paper contributes to disciplines including Transportation Engineering, Communication Systems, and Intelligent Transportation Systems, with interdisciplinary links to Vehicular Technology and Urban Planning."

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts include: (1) Route Guidance Systems (RGS) - systems that provide traffic information and routing advice to optimize travel time and reduce congestion; (2) V2X Communication - vehicle-to-everything technologies enabling data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and other entities; (3) Integration Framework - a proposed structure combining transportation and communication networks for robust RGS applications.",
        "The logical relationship network shows that RGS depends on V2X communication for real-time data to function effectively; the integration framework acts as a mediator, ensuring that communication technologies meet RGS requirements, leading to improved system performance and reliability.",
        "Key assumptions include: communication technologies (e.g., DSRC, C-V2X) can be evaluated for their suitability in RGS; traffic assignment models (static and dynamic) are foundational to RGS; and real-time data integration is feasible despite potential delays or packet loss.",
        "The paper makes a synthesis and framework contribution to the knowledge system by reviewing and classifying existing literature, identifying gaps, and proposing a novel integration approach, thereby advancing theoretical and practical understanding in ITS."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "The core research method is a systematic literature review using PRISMA methodology, involving bibliographic searches in databases (SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, etc.) with specific keywords, screening for relevance, and synthesizing findings from 113 selected documents.",
        "The methodology's novelty lies in its comprehensive and structured approach to categorizing RGS architectures and V2X technologies; applicability is high for researchers and practitioners in ITS; rationality is demonstrated through rigorous filtering and analysis of literature over the last decade.",
        "Data sources include academic databases with documents from the last ten years; characteristics encompass peer-reviewed studies on RGS and V2X; preprocessing involves eliminating duplicates and reviewing abstracts for relevance. Representativeness is evaluated as strong due to multiple databases and PRISMA adherence, covering diverse perspectives.",
        "The research design is rigorous with clear eligibility criteria and phased screening, but lacks experimental components; evaluation metrics are adequate for a review, focusing on qualitative synthesis and classification, though quantitative analysis is limited to document counts.",
        "The research follows an empirical review paradigm based on ITS literature, affecting the perspective by prioritizing evidence from existing studies over theoretical modeling, thus emphasizing practical insights and gaps in real-world implementation."
