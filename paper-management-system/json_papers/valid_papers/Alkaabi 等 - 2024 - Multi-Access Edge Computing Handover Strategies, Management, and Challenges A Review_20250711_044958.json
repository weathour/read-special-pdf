    "abstract": "The deployment of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) at the network edge provides low-latency computing and storage services. Device mobility necessitates handover strategies to migrate device and application states between MEC nodes. This paper reviews MEC handover strategies, describes the ETSI reference architecture and handover algorithms, and discusses challenges and knowledge gaps to guide future work.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and comparative analysis of existing MEC handover approaches, including algorithm classification, architectural frameworks, and experimental evaluations.",
    "conclusion": "MEC handover is essential for mobility support in 5G/IoT applications. Key challenges include lack of standardized protocols, energy efficiency, and QoS maintenance during state relocation. Future work should focus on robust handover protocols and improved resource management.",
