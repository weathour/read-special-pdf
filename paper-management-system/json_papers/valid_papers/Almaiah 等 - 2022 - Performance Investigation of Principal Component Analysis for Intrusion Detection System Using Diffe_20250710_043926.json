    "abstract": "The growing number of security threats has prompted the use of a variety of security techniques. The most common security tools for identifying and tracking intruders across diverse network domains are intrusion detection systems. Machine Learning classifiers have begun to be used in the detection of threats, thus increasing the intrusion detection systems' performance. In this paper, the investigation model for an intrusion detection systems model based on the Principal Component Analysis feature selection technique and a different Support Vector Machine kernels classifier is present. The impact of various kernel functions used in Support Vector Machines, namely linear, polynomial, Gaussian radial basis function, and Sigmoid, is investigated. The performance of the investigation model is measured in terms of detection accuracy, True Positive, True Negative, Precision, Sensitivity, and F-measure to choose an appropriate kernel function for the Support Vector Machine. The investigation model was examined and evaluated using the KDD Cup 99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets. The obtained results prove that the Gaussian radial basis function kernel is superior to the linear, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels in both used datasets. Obtained accuracy, Sensitivity, and F-measure of the Gaussian radial basis function kernel for KDD CUP 99 were 99.11%, 98.97%, and 99.03%. For UNSW-NB15 datasets were 93.94%, 93.23%, and 94.44%.",
    "methodology": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with four kernel functions (linear, polynomial, Gaussian radial basis function, sigmoid) for classification. Evaluated using KDD Cup 99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets with performance metrics including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F-measure.",
    "conclusion": "The Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel outperformed linear, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels in both datasets. For KDD Cup 99, RBF achieved 99.11% accuracy, 98.97% sensitivity, and 99.03% F-measure. For UNSW-NB15, RBF achieved 93.94% accuracy, 93.23% sensitivity, and 94.44% F-measure.",
