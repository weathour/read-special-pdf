    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an important concept, bridging the physical and digital worlds through interconnected devices. Although the idea of interconnected devices predates the term 'Internet of Things', which was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, the vision of a seamlessly integrated world of devices has been accelerated by advancements in wireless technologies, cost-effective computing, and the ubiquity of mobile devices. This study aims to provide an in-depth review of existing and emerging IoT simulators focusing on their capabilities and real-world applications, and discuss the current challenges and future trends in the IoT simulation area. Despite substantial research in the IoT simulation domain, many studies have a narrow focus, leaving a gap in comprehensive reviews that consider broader IoT development metrics, such as device mobility, energy models, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and scalability. Notably, there is a lack of literature examining IoT simulators' capabilities in supporting renewable energy sources and their integration with Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) simulations. Our review seeks to address this gap, evaluating the ability of IoT simulators to simulate complex, large-scale IoT scenarios and meet specific developmental requirements, as well as examining the current challenges and future trends in the field of IoT simulation.",
    "methodology": "Systematic literature review following PRISMA standards, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed open-source IoT simulators published since 2014. Inclusion criteria focused on active maintenance, IoT device/network modeling, and real-world applicability.",
    "conclusion": "Key gaps include the absence of a generic simulator for diverse IoT scenarios, insufficient support for renewable energy sources and VANET integration, and limited attention to security (e.g., battery depletion attacks). Future IoT simulators must address mobility, SDN, energy modeling, and scalability to meet evolving IoT demands.",
