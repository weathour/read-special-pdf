    "abstract": "This paper investigates resource allocation optimization for sidelink Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication, focusing on platooning during the 5G to 6G transition. We emphasize the importance of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in C-V2X Mode 4 optimization, incorporating significant enhancements such as distance-based queue modeling. Despite Mode 4's similarities to 5G V2X Mode 2, our approach maintains a Markov chain perspective. Our primary contribution is a tailored distance-based queue model for C-V2X platooning scenarios, vital for advanced V2X applications in 6G environments. By integrating spatial considerations into the semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) algorithm, we demonstrate the impact of distance and queue dynamics on resource allocation efficiency. This research sets a standard for future vehicular communication systems. Initial parameter selection for the proposed queue model relies on empirical data from the TiHAN testbed at IIT Hyderabad.",
