    "abstract": "Academic research in the field of autonomous vehicles has reached high popularity in recent years related to several topics as sensor technologies, V2X communications, safety, security, decision making, control, and even legal and standardization rules. Besides classic control design approaches, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods are present in almost all of these fields. Another part of research focuses on different layers of Motion Planning, such as strategic decisions, trajectory planning, and control. A wide range of techniques in Machine Learning itself have been developed, and this article describes one of these fields, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The paper provides insight into the hierarchical motion planning problem and describes the basics of DRL. The main elements of designing such a system are the modeling of the environment, the modeling abstractions, the description of the state and the perception models, the appropriate rewarding, and the realization of the underlying neural network. The paper describes vehicle models, simulation possibilities and computational requirements. Strategic decisions on different layers and the observation models, e.g., continuous and discrete state representations, grid-based, and camera-based solutions are presented. The paper surveys the state-of-art solutions systematized by the different tasks and levels of autonomous driving, such as car-following, lane-keeping, trajectory following, merging, or driving in dense traffic. Finally, open questions and future challenges are discussed.",

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: (1) Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) - models environment state transitions with partial observability; (2) Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - combines neural networks with RL for policy/value approximation; (3) Hierarchical Motion Planning - decomposes driving into route planning, behavioral layer, motion planning, and local control.",
        "Logical relationships: POMDP provides the mathematical foundation for DRL, which is applied to hierarchical layers; DRL techniques (e.g., DQN for discrete actions, DDPG for continuous actions) optimize policies based on rewards derived from motion planning objectives.",
        "Key assumptions include simulated environments for safe training, idealized sensor models or ground truth observations, and cooperative or competitive behaviors in multi-agent settings.",
        "The paper makes a synthesizing contribution by categorizing and evaluating existing DRL approaches, identifying gaps, and proposing future research directions rather than introducing new algorithms."

      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods involve reviewing DRL techniques (e.g., DQN, DDPG, policy gradients) applied to motion planning layers, with scenario-based classifications (e.g., car-following, lane-keeping, merging) using simulated environments like SUMO, TORCS, and CARLA.",
        "Methodology novelty lies in DRL's ability to handle unstructured data (e.g., images, grids) compared to classic methods; applicability is evaluated across tasks, though limited by computational demands; rationality is assessed through trade-offs between model accuracy (e.g., kinematic vs. dynamic vehicle models) and training efficiency.",
        "Data sources are simulation-based (e.g., Udacity simulator, NGSIM dataset for imitation learning); characteristics include grid-based occupancy, vehicle state vectors, or raw sensor data; representativeness is constrained by simulation fidelity, with preprocessing (e.g., semantic segmentation) used to bridge reality gaps.",
        "Experimental design rigor varies across surveyed studies, with metrics like collision avoidance, travel time, and passenger comfort; evaluation adequacy is critiqued for lack of real-world validation and over-reliance on task-specific rewards.",
