    "abstract": "Nowadays, due to improvements in seismic codes and computational devices, retrofitting buildings is an important topic, in which, permanent deformation of buildings, known as Residual Interstory Drift Ratio (RIDR), plays a crucial role. To provide an accurate yet reliable prediction model, 32 improved Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were considered using Python software to investigate the best method for estimating Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (IDRmax) and RIDR of 384 Steel Moment-Resisting Frames (SMRFs). In addition, the curve plot ability of methods was investigated to provide an estimation of Median of IDA curve (IDAMed) and Seismic Failure Probability curve (SFPCurve) considering Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) effects. ML algorithms were improved with a pipeline-based hyper-parameters Fine-Tuning (FT) method followed by forward and backward feature selection methodologies to avoid overfitting and data leakage issues. The results show that proposed methods have higher prediction accuracy and curve fitting ability (more than 95%) that can be used to estimate IDAMed and SFPCurve of a structure to accelerate seismic risk assessment.",

    "conclusion": "Improved ML methods achieve >95% accuracy in predicting IDRmax/RIDR and curve-fitting IDAMed/SFPCurve; LightGBM, BR(FT), and ANNs are top performers; validated on general structures with reliable seismic risk assessment capabilities.",
