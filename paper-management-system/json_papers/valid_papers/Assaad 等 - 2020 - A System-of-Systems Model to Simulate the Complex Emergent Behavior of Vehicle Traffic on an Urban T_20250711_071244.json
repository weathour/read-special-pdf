    "abstract": "Transportation agencies face escalating challenges in forecasting the traffic demand. Traditional prediction methods focused on individual transportation sectors and failed to study the inter-dependencies between the different transportation systems. Hence, there is a need for more advanced and holistic modeling techniques. To this end, this paper models and analyses an urban transportation system-of-systems incorporating seven various systems: population and GDP, CO2 emission, gasoline price and total vehicle trips, traffic demand, public and private transportation, transportation investment, and traffic congestion. Accordingly, this research simulates transportation networks as a collection of task-oriented systems that combine their resources to form a complex system with increased functionality. The developed model incorporates a hybrid modeling approach that includes: logistic model, system dynamics, stochastic cellular automata, chaos theory, and Lotka-Volterra model. The final model is demonstrated using a case study. The contribution of this paper lies in modeling the transportation network as a dynamic system of systems rather than as static model as provided in previous studies.",

It advances beyond static models by enabling better traffic demand prediction and network management.",

        "Transportation systems are crucial for economies but face challenges in demand forecasting due to overlooked interdependencies between sectors like traffic, emissions, and public transit.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include system dynamics for feedback loops, logistic models for population, chaos theory for gasoline prices, Lotka-Volterra for public-private competition, and stochastic cellular automata for congestion simulation.",
        "Novelty lies in hybrid integration; applicable to any urban scale; rational due to alignment with complex system behaviors but limited by assumptions like fixed capacity.",
        "Data from historical sources (e.g., Energy Information Administration for gasoline prices, Florida DOT for transportation fractions); preprocessing involves calibration (e.g., fitting chaos parameters); representativeness is adequate for the case study but may not generalize universally.",
        "Experimental design includes a case study (Hillsborough County) with error metrics (e.g., 9.31% for gasoline price); evaluation uses R-square for curve fitting, but rigor is constrained by simplifications like ignoring HOV lanes.",
