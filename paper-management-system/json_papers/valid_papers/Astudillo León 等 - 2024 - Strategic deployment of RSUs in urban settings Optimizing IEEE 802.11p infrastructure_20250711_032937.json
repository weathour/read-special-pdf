    "abstract": "The efficient deployment of Roadside Units (RSUs) in an infrastructure based on IEEE 802.11p is essential for delivering Internet-based services to vehicles. This paper introduces novel strategies relying solely on average vehicular density within urban areas, guided by an analytical performance model of IEEE 802.11p. These strategies minimize upfront information requirements for practicality. Validation through ns-3 and SUMO simulations in Berlin, Manhattan, and Beijing scenarios demonstrates that efficient RSU deployment is city-specific, optimal placement avoids highest-density locations to maximize QoS-compliant vehicles, and disabling the lowest transmission rate reduces RSU requirements.",
    "methodology": "Combined analytical modeling of IEEE 802.11p throughput with SUMO-simulated vehicular mobility and ns-3 network simulations. Proposed three greedy RSU deployment strategies (Max Density, Max Density Radio Range, Max Vehicles Served) using density matrices, penetration rates, and QoS targets.",
    "conclusion": "1) RSU deployment must be tailored to unique city characteristics (street layout, spatial density). 2) Optimal strategy places RSUs to maximize vehicles receiving target QoS, not at peak density locations. 3) Disabling the lowest IEEE 802.11p transmission rate reduces RSU count despite shorter radio range. 4) Deployment efficiency depends on penetration rate and city-specific factors.",
