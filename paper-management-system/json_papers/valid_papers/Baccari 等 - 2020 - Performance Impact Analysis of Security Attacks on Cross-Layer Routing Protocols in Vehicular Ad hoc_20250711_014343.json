    "abstract": "Recently, several cross-layer protocols have been designed for vehicular networks to optimize data dissemination by ensuring internal communications between routing and MAC layers. In this context, a cross-layer protocol, called TDMA-aware Routing Protocol for Multi-hop communications (TRPM), was proposed in order to efficiently select a relay node based on time slot scheduling information obtained from the MAC layer. However, due to the constant evolution of cyber-attacks on the routing and MAC layers, data dissemination in vehicular networks is vulnerable to several types of attack. In this paper, we identify the different attack models that can disrupt the cross-layer operation of the TRPM protocol and assess their impact on performance through simulation. Several new vulnerabilities related to the MAC slot scheduling process are identified. Exploiting of these vulnerabilities would lead to severe channel capacity wastage where up to half of the free slots could not be reserved.",
    "methodology": "Simulation-based analysis using NS2 simulator with SUMO-generated traffic scenarios, evaluating performance under attack models (Black-hole, Gray-hole, and MAC-level attacks) with metrics including Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End-to-End Delay (EED), and channel usage ratio across varying vehicle densities.",
    "conclusion": "TRPM protocol is highly vulnerable to identified attacks, with severe performance degradation including PDR drops to 13% under Black-hole attacks, EED increases up to 1.8s exceeding safety thresholds, and channel wastage of up to 47%, necessitating future development of detection and prevention solutions.",
