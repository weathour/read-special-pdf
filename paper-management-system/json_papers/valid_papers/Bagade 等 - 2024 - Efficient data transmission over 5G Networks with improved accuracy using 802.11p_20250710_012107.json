    "abstract": "High-quality data traffic management providing ultra-low latency and less circuit complexity are the technical challenges for 5G cellular networks in recent years. To address the increased data rate traffic and enhance the user experience, buffer management with effective utilization of resources are 5G networks. The existing research contains uncompressed or raw video data transmission over a double buffer system. The spectrum is always busy with information if uncompressed data is sent. Transmission delays occur while packet transmission and receiver systems result in video buffering. The authors proposed an optimized resource framework in this research paper by compressing data using a modified H.265 Lagrangian Encoder and transmitting data using a single buffer technique. The transmission delays are mitigated, and data buffering is minimized with reduced transmission errors. The proposed method is tested and verified with various errors like collision error, propagation error, sensing error, and accuracy. The proposed model gives an improvement in accuracy when compared with the existing model.",
