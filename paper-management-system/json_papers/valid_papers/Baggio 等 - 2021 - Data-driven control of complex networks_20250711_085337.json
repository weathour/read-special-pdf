    "abstract": "Our ability to manipulate the behavior of complex networks depends on efficient control algorithms and accurate network models. This paper develops a data-driven framework to control complex networks optimally without knowledge of network dynamics. Optimal controls are constructed using finite experimental data where the network is stimulated with arbitrary inputs. The method is provably correct for linear networks and characterized for noisy data and nonlinear dynamics in power grids and brain networks.",
    "methodology": "Derives closed-form data-driven expressions for optimal control inputs using experimental data matrices. Focuses on point-to-point control for linear network dynamics with quadratic costs. Validates performance against noise and nonlinear systems.",
    "conclusion": "Data-driven controls overcome model uncertainty limitations, offer computational advantages, and enable accurate network manipulation. Applications include synchronization control in oscillators, power-grid fault recovery, and fMRI-based brain network control. Future work should address nonlinearities and closed-loop strategies.",
