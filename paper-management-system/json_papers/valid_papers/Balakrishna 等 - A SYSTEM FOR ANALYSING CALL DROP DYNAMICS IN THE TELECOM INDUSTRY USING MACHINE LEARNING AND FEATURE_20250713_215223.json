    "abstract": "Quality of service in the telecom industry plays a vital role in the growth and economy of the country. In India, several telecom operators provide services, and there is a regulatory authority known as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). In the telecom domain, call dropping is a problem that deteriorates the performance of the telecom industry in rendering services. It also causes inconvenience and waste of time for users, as well as reducing the level of user satisfaction. There is a need for a technology-driven analysis with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze call drop dynamics toward making well-informed decisions. The existing research revealed that Machine Learning (ML) helps analyze call drop dynamics. However, there is a need for a framework with machine learning techniques and optimizations to improve performance in analyzing call drop dynamics in the telecom industry. In this paper, we proposed an ML framework for automatic analysis of all drops in the telecom industry across all operators. The framework also supports optimizations like future engineering and dimensionality reduction to improve the performance of machine learning models. We proposed an algorithm called Learning based Call Drop Analytics (LbCDA) which exploits feature selection and training multiple classifiers towards call drop analytics. With benchmark dataset variants of the telecom industry, our empirical study has revealed that our framework's Random Forest (RF) model outperforms other models with the highest accuracy of 87.40 .",
    "methodology": "The research employs a machine learning framework involving exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (using Principal Component Analysis), and multiple classifiers including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The proposed Learning based Call Drop Analytics (LbCDA) algorithm uses feature selection and trains multiple classifiers for call drop prediction.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed ML framework, particularly the Random Forest model, achieved the highest accuracy of 87.40% in call drop analytics, outperforming other models. This system can help telecom operators understand and mitigate call drop issues, improving service quality and user satisfaction. Future work includes enhancing the framework with deep learning models and hyperparameter tuning.",
