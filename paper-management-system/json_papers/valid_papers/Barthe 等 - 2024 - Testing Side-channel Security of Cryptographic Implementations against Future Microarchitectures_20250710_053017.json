    "abstract": "How will future microarchitectures impact the security of existing cryptographic implementations? As reducing transistor size becomes challenging, chip vendors develop microarchitectural optimizations to speed up computation. A recent study suggests these optimizations might enable new microarchitectural attacks. This paper develops (i) LmSpec, a domain-specific language for specifying leakage models of optimizations, and (ii) LmTest, a testing framework to detect leaks under specified models. An empirical study of 18 optimizations on 25 implementations from five libraries shows every implementation would contain secret-dependent leaks—sometimes sufficient to recover secret keys—if optimizations were realized. Ironically, some leaks arise from constant-time coding idioms used to prevent standard leaks.",
    "methodology": "Developed LmSpec language for specifying leakage models (leakage and prediction clauses) and LmTest framework for relational random testing. Generated low-equivalent input pairs, executed programs via Unicorn emulator with LmSpec instrumentation, and compared leakage traces to detect secret-dependent differences.",
    "conclusion": "All 25 cryptographic implementations tested would leak secrets under proposed microarchitectural optimizations. Some leaks enable full key recovery, and ironically, constant-time countermeasures (e.g., masked swaps) introduce new vulnerabilities under these models.",

      "Overview": "The paper addresses how future microarchitectural optimizations could compromise cryptographic implementation security. It develops LmSpec (a language for leakage modeling) and LmTest (a testing tool) to evaluate side-channel risks, conducting an empirical study on 25 implementations under 108 leakage models.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Chip vendors are exploring microarchitectural optimizations due to physical limits in transistor scaling, but prior work (Sanchez Vicarte et al.) warns these may introduce new attack vectors.",
        "Lack of tools to evaluate security impacts of future optimizations motivates a framework for chip vendors/developers to assess leaks early.",
        "Authors argue optimizations could undermine existing cryptographic safeguards, making pre-silicon security assessment urgent to prevent vulnerabilities.",
        "Specific problem (microarchitectural leaks) links to broader hardware security challenges; significance is established via potential key-extraction risks.",
        "Contributes to computer security, cryptography, and computer architecture disciplines."

        "LmSpec defines leaks, while LmTest operationalizes detection via trace comparisons. Speculation extends leakage scope via prediction clauses.",

        "Provides practical tools (LmSpec/LmTest) for prototyping and evaluation, advancing capability to anticipate novel side-channels."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core: LmSpec’s executable semantics (via Unicorn emulator hooks) derive leakage traces; LmTest uses random relational testing with labeled interfaces.",
        "Novelty: Parametric in leakage models (unlike fixed-model tools); applicability to any x86 binary; rational via worst-case speculation (always-mispredict).",
        "Data: 25 implementations from 5 libraries (e.g., libsodium, rust-crypto). Inputs: Randomly generated low-equivalent pairs; representativeness ensured by covering diverse algorithms (AES, X25519, etc.).",
        "Experimental design: 100 test cases per model, per-implementation timeouts; rigor via differential trace analysis.",
        "Follows constant-time non-interference paradigm, affecting focus on microarchitectural deviations from this model."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "All 25 implementations showed leaks under ≥1 leakage model. Key-recovery vulnerabilities found (e.g., X25519 in libsodium). Constant-time idioms (e.g., masked swaps) introduced leaks under optimizations like silent stores.",
        "Results are significant (expose universal vulnerability), reliable (detected via trace differences), and stable (consistent across libraries/Rust/verified code)."

        "Limitations: Models simplify hardware; random testing may miss corner cases; per-test-case timeouts limited coverage.",
        "Theoretical constraints: Non-interference model ignores measurement noise; always-mispredict speculation may overestimate risk."
