    "abstract": "We introduce a new PKE protocol, POKÉ, based on isogenies of unknown degree. The protocol relies on two new techniques: the first constructs an SIDH square while also working with higher-dimensional representations, whereas the second allows us to obtain a shared secret even when all curves in the commutative diagram are known. The resulting protocol is compact and extremely efficient. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation in SageMath of POKÉ that shows encryption and decryption taking about a hundred milliseconds at security level I: POKÉ is thus the most efficient encryption protocol from isogenies, and it outperforms existing protocols by more than an order of magnitude.",
    "methodology": "Combines higher-dimensional isogeny representations with commutative diagrams (SIDH squares) using isogenies of unknown degree. Introduces public-private isogeny representations and point-based shared secret derivation.",
    "conclusion": "POKÉ achieves unprecedented efficiency in isogeny-based encryption, with ~100ms encryption/decryption at NIST Level I security. It leverages higher-dimensional isogenies to avoid SIDH attacks while maintaining compact parameters (prime size ~10λ/3 bits).",
