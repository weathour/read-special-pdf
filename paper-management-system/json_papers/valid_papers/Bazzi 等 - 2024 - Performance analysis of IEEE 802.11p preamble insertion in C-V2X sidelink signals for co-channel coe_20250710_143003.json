    "abstract": "Spectrum scarcity is a main challenge for future wireless technologies, amplified in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) where sharing impacts road safety. This paper studies coexistence solutions for IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X sidelink Mode 4 in the same geographical area and channels. Beyond analyzing mutual interference impacts, a mitigation solution based on inserting the IEEE 802.11p preamble at the start of each LTE-V2X transmission is extensively evaluated. Requiring no changes to IEEE 802.11p and minor LTE-V2X modifications, this proposal is applicable to IEEE 802.11bd and extendable to NR-V2X. Analysis and simulations demonstrate collision mitigation under low/high loads, with additional congestion control mechanisms enhancing effectiveness.",

    "conclusion": "Inserting IEEE 802.11p preambles in LTE-V2X signals significantly reduces inter-technology collisions in co-channel coexistence scenarios. The solution maintains performance for individual technologies and shows effectiveness across free-flow and dense conditions. In congested scenarios, combining preamble insertion with modified LTE-V2X congestion control provides optimal fairness and reliability.",
