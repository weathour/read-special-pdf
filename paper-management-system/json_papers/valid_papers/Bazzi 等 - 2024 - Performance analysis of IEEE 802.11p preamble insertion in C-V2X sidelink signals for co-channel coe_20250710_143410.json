    "abstract": "Spectrum scarcity is a key challenge for future wireless technologies, amplified in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications where spectrum sharing impacts road safety and traffic efficiency. This paper studies solutions enabling coexistence of IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X sidelink Mode 4 in the same geographical area and channels. Beyond analyzing mutual interference—which strongly affects IEEE 802.11p under congestion—a mitigation solution is extensively evaluated: inserting the IEEE 802.11p preamble at the start of each LTE-V2X sidelink transmission. This standardization-compatible approach requires no changes to IEEE 802.11p and minor LTE-V2X modifications. Analysis and simulations in free-flow and dense scenarios demonstrate collision mitigation under low/high loads, with further improvements achievable via congestion control mechanisms.",
    "methodology": "Mathematical modeling for free-flow scenarios and open-source simulations (WiLabV2Xsim) for dense/congested environments. Evaluates packet reception probability (PRP) and data age (DA) metrics. Proposes preamble insertion in LTE-V2X signals to enhance IEEE 802.11p sensing capabilities.",
    "conclusion": "Preamble insertion significantly reduces inter-technology collisions, improving coexistence under diverse traffic conditions. The solution remains effective in congestion when combined with LTE-V2X congestion control adjustments. It is backward-compatible with IEEE 802.11bd and extendable to NR-V2X.",
