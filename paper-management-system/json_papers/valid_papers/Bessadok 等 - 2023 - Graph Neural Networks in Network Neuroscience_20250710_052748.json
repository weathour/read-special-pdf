    "abstract": "Noninvasive medical neuroimaging has yielded many discoveries about brain connectivity. Several substantial techniques mapping morphological, structural, and functional brain connectivities were developed to create a comprehensive roadmap of neuronal activities in the human brain, namely brain graph. Relying on its non-Euclidean data type, graph neural network (GNN) provides a clever way of learning the deep graph structure and is rapidly becoming the state-of-the-art leading to enhanced performance in various network neuroscience tasks. Here we review current GNN-based methods, highlighting their use in applications related to brain graphs such as missing brain graph synthesis and disease classification. We conclude by charting a path toward better application of GNN models in network neuroscience for neurological disorder diagnosis and population graph integration.",
    "methodology": "Literature review of Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods applied to brain graphs in network neuroscience, categorizing approaches into brain graph prediction (cross-domain, cross-resolution, cross-time), integration, and classification. Analysis includes GNN architectures like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT).",
    "conclusion": "GNNs show promise for brain graph analysis but require improvements in reproducibility, explainability, and clinical translation. Future directions include multimodal brain graph synthesis, few-shot learning, and enhanced model interpretability for neurological disorder diagnosis.",
