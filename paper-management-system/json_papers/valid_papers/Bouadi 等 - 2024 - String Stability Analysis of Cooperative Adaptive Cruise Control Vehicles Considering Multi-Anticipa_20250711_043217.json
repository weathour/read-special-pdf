    "abstract": "This study investigates the stability of multi-anticipative CACC vehicles with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication delay using Lyapunov methods. Key findings include: (i) The Lyapunov function method overcomes transfer function limitations for multi-anticipative models, while the Lyapunov functional method accurately predicts delay impacts; (ii) Multi-anticipative models ensure traffic stability and high capacity; (iii) Critical instability wavelength follows a power law when acceleration sensitivity is excluded; (iv) Realistic communication delays minimally affect CACC stability.",

    "conclusion": "Multi-anticipation enhances CACC stability while maintaining high throughput. Communication delays (≤0.2s) have negligible destabilizing effects.
