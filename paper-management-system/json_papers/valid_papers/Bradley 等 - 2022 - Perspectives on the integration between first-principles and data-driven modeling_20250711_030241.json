    "abstract": "Efficiently embedding and/or integrating mechanistic information with data-driven models is essential to simultaneously leverage engineering principles and data-science. Hybridization addresses scenarios like developing faster surrogates for high-fidelity models, correcting incomplete mechanistic models, or approximating unknown correlations within mechanistic frameworks. This paper reviews hybrid modeling, physics-informed machine learning (PI-ML), and model calibration—comparing their methods, challenges, applications, similarities, advantages, limitations, and future perspectives—illustrated via a chemical reactor case study.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and comparative analysis of three hybridization approaches: Hybrid Submodeling (HSM), Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PI-ML), and Model Calibration (MC), supplemented by a chemical reactor case study.",
    "conclusion": "HSM, PI-ML, and MC offer complementary strategies for integrating physics with data-driven models. HSM excels in dynamic systems but faces extrapolation challenges; PI-ML enhances interpretability with physics constraints but requires careful hyperparameter tuning; MC quantifies uncertainty but suffers from identifiability issues. Future work should address computational scalability, theoretical guarantees, and real-time applications.",

      "Overview": "Review comparing three hybridization techniques—Hybrid Submodeling (HSM), Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PI-ML), and Model Calibration (MC)—for integrating mechanistic knowledge with data-driven models in Process Systems Engineering (PSE), emphasizing dynamical systems and chemical engineering applications.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Rapid ML advancements raise debates on balancing data-driven methods with physics-based principles in PSE, particularly concerning ML's black-box nature, poor extrapolation, and unquantified uncertainty.",
        "Hybridization addresses reliability gaps by leveraging both data and physics, building on concepts developed since the 1990s.",
        "The urgency stems from increasing industrial complexity requiring interpretable, data-efficient models that satisfy physical constraints.",

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: (1) Hybrid Submodeling (HSM): Couples mechanistic equations with data-driven submodels; (2) Physics-Informed ML (PI-ML): Embeds physical constraints (e.g., PDEs) into ML loss functions; (3) Model Calibration (MC): Uses Bayesian methods to tune mechanistic parameters and model discrepancies.",
        "Logical relationships: HSM and PI-ML directly embed physics into model structures, while MC statistically infers parameters; all aim to enhance accuracy/generalizability but differ in uncertainty handling.",
