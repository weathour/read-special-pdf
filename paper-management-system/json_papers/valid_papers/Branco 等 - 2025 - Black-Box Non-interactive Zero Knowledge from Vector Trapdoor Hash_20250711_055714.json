    "abstract": "We present a new approach for constructing non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof systems from vector trapdoor hashing (VTDH)—a generalization of trapdoor hashing [Döttling et al., Crypto 19]. Unlike prior applications of trapdoor hash to NIZKs, we use VTDH to realize the hidden bits model [Feige-Lapidot-Shamir, FOCS 90] leading to black-box constructions of NIZKs. This approach gives us the following new results: A statistically-sound NIZK proof system based on the hardness of decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) and learning parity with noise (LPN) over finite fields with inverse polynomial noise rate. This gives the first statistically sound NIZK proof system that is not based on either LWE, or bilinear maps, or factoring. A dual-mode NIZK satisfying statistical zero-knowledge in the common random string mode and statistical soundness in the common reference string mode assuming the hardness of learning with errors (LWE) with polynomial modulus-to-noise ratio. This gives the first black-box construction of such a dual-mode NIZK under LWE. This improves the recent work of Waters (STOC 24) which relied on LWE with super-polynomial modulus-to-noise ratio and required a setup phase with private coins. The above constructions are black-box and satisfy single-theorem zero-knowledge property. Building on the works of Feige et al. (FOCS 90) and Fischlin and Rohrback (PKC 21), we upgrade these constructions (under the same assumptions) to satisfy multi-theorem zero-knowledge property at the expense of making non-black-box use of cryptography.",

    "conclusion": "VTDH enables efficient black-box NIZK constructions under standard assumptions: (1) First statistically sound NIZK without LWE, bilinear maps, or factoring; (2) First black-box dual-mode NIZK from LWE with polynomial modulus-to-noise ratio, improving prior super-polynomial requirements.",
