    "abstract": "Despite been obtained for the connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in last decades, various of realistic problems still exist, which exactly block the large-scale application of CAVs. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a novel stochastic cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategy to realize the stable control of nonhomogeneous vehicle platoon system with simultaneously suffering from the on-board sensor data distortion, random wind disturbance, and communication delay. First, the dynamics model of the nonhomogeneous platoon with variant vehicle masses and lengths is built based on the predecessor-leader following (PLF) communication topology. Then, the simplified characteristic of sensor data distortion resulting from the limited sensing range is depicted in line with the variation of headway spacing. Thereafter, the random wind velocity is treated as the Gaussian white noise and incorporated into the platoon system via employing the Ito stochastic differential. The varying road slope and communication delay are also accommodated in unison. Next, the distributed robust H controller is generated via the stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Moreover, the condition for string stability is derived with the defined stochastic L2 stability criterion. Finally, numerical simulations and real-time hardware in loop (HiL) experiment demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",
    "methodology": "The paper employs a stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach to design a distributed robust H controller for a nonhomogeneous vehicle platoon system. The methodology includes modeling sensor data distortion, stochastic wind disturbance, and communication delays, and deriving conditions for string stability using a stochastic L2 stability criterion.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed stochastic CACC strategy effectively stabilizes nonhomogeneous vehicle platoons under sensor data distortion, random wind disturbance, and communication delays. Numerical simulations and HiL experiments validate the controller's feasibility and robustness.",
