    "abstract": "This brief report summarizes the first IEEE Distributed Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Future Directions of Intelligent Vehicles (IEEE DHW-FDIV), focusing on meta-vehicles and metaverses for smart mobility and intelligent transportation. It addresses current issues in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) and potential future research topics, covering six key directions: new ecology for intelligent vehicles with 6I, meta-vehicles in metaverses, true DAOs for intelligent vehicles with blockchains, intelligent mobile spaces, intelligent vehicles for carbon neutrality and green transportation, and driving into 6S societies. The workshop involved participants from Asia, Europe, and North America, with discussions emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches to achieve safe, secure, sustainable, sensitive, servable, and smart societies.",
    "methodology": "Descriptive workshop report summarizing discussions, debates, and communications from two events and follow-up emails/WeChat exchanges. The methodology involves synthesizing expert insights on future research directions without primary data collection or experiments.",
    "conclusion": "Intelligent vehicles are pivotal for achieving 6S societies (Safety, Security, Sustainability, Sensitivity, Servability, Smartness). A Systems of Intelligent Vehicular Systems (SoIVS) approach is essential, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration. Future research should explore technologies like parallel intelligence, blockchains, and eco-friendly systems to address challenges in vehicular ethics, operation, and sustainability.",

      "Overview": "The paper is a workshop report discussing future research directions for intelligent vehicles, covering topics like meta-vehicles, parallel intelligence, DAOs, green transportation, and interdisciplinary approaches to achieve societal goals in safety, security, and sustainability.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The research addresses challenges in intelligent vehicles and transportation systems, such as integrating emerging technologies and achieving carbon neutrality.",
        "Motivation stems from the need to explore new paradigms like metaverse applications and decentralized systems to enhance vehicular intelligence and sustainability.",
        "Authors argue for necessity by highlighting societal urgencies, including road transportation's contribution to global CO2 emissions and the limitations of current vehicular technologies.",
        "Specific problems like vehicular ethics and operational inefficiencies are linked to broader challenges of sustainable development and cybersecurity, establishing significance through global agreements like the Paris accord.",
        "Contributions span intelligent transportation systems, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and environmental science, emphasizing interdisciplinary fields."
      ],
      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: Meta-Vehicles (virtual representations in metaverses for intelligent transportation), Parallel Intelligence (integrating cyber-physical-social systems to create transparent virtual-real interactions), DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations enabling decentralized operations via blockchains).",
        "Logical relationships: Meta-vehicles leverage parallel intelligence for virtual-real integration, while DAOs use blockchain to support decentralized vehicular operations, collectively aiming to advance intelligent vehicles toward 6S societal goals.",
        "Key assumptions include the feasibility of integrating advanced technologies like AI and blockchain, and the necessity of human trust and attention as commodifiable elements in metaverses.",
        "The paper makes a conceptual contribution by proposing novel frameworks (e.g., 6I ecology) that extend existing knowledge in intelligent systems and transportation."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods involve qualitative synthesis of workshop discussions and expert communications, without empirical data collection or technical experiments.",
        "Methodology's novelty lies in collaborative ideation; applicability is high for setting research agendas but lacks rationality for practical implementation due to absence of empirical testing.",
        "Data sources are discussions from 23 and 12 participants across two events, with characteristics of expert opinions; representativeness is limited to workshop attendees, lacking broader demographic diversity.",
        "Experimental design is non-existent, and evaluation metrics are not applied, reducing rigor; the approach is descriptive and speculative.",
        "The research follows a systems thinking paradigm, emphasizing interdisciplinary perspectives, which broadens the scope but may overlook domain-specific technical constraints."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Key results include six future directions: 6I-based ecology, meta-vehicles in metaverses, DAO integration, intelligent mobile spaces, carbon neutrality pathways, and 6S societal goals.",
        "Results are significant for providing a visionary roadmap but lack reliability and stability as they are based on discussions without empirical validation."
      ],
      "Argumentation_and_Logic": [
        "Overall structure is thematic, organized into sections for each future direction, building a case for interdisciplinary innovation.",
        "Key steps: Introduce concepts (e.g., meta-vehicles), discuss enabling technologies (e.g., blockchains), link to societal benefits (e.g., sustainability), and conclude with calls for action.",
        "Strengths include comprehensive coverage of emerging topics; weaknesses involve speculative reasoning without addressing counterarguments, such as feasibility challenges. Authors mitigate rebuttals by referencing prior work but offer no direct evidence."
      ],
      "Strengths_and_Limitations": [
        "Strengths: Innovative synthesis of concepts like parallel intelligence and DAOs, with a visionary interdisciplinary approach.",
        "Limitations: Methodological boundaries due to lack of empirical data; conclusions are theoretical and untested.",
        "The choice of systems thinking constrains conclusions by prioritizing holistic views over technical details, potentially overlooking practical implementation barriers."
      ],
      "Academic_Discourse_and_Rhetoric": [
        "The paper positions itself as an agenda-setting discourse in intelligent vehicles, advocating for paradigm shifts like metaverse integration.",
        "Authors use specialized terminology (e.g., 'meta-vehicles', 'parallel intelligence') with a persuasive tone, employing rhetorical strategies like analogies to historical philosophies (e.g., Dao) to enhance credibility.",
        "Authority is built through citations of foundational works by key authors (e.g., Fei-Yue Wang), with motivations to establish continuity in their research lineage and promote IEEE TIV's leadership."
