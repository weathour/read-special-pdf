    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on simple bilevel optimization problems, where we minimize a convex smooth objective function over the optimal solution set of another convex smooth constrained optimization problem. We present a novel bilevel optimization method that locally approximates the solution set of the lower-level problem using a cutting plane approach and employs an accelerated gradient-based update to reduce the upper-level objective function over the approximated solution set. We measure the performance of our method in terms of suboptimality and infeasibility errors and provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for both error criteria. Specifically, when the feasible set is compact, we show that our method requires at most O(max{1/√ϵ_f, 1/ϵ_g}) iterations to find a solution that is ϵ_f-suboptimal and ϵ_g-infeasible. Moreover, under the additional assumption that the lower-level objective satisfies the r-th Hölderian error bound, we show that our method achieves an iteration complexity of O(max{ϵ_f^{-2r/(2r+1)}, ϵ_g^{-2r/(2r+1)}}), which matches the optimal complexity of single-level convex constrained optimization when r=1.",

    "conclusion": "AGM-BiO achieves state-of-the-art non-asymptotic guarantees: O(max{1/√ϵ_f, 1/ϵ_g}) complexity for compact feasible sets, and O(max{ϵ_f^{-2r/(2r+1)}, ϵ_g^{-2r/(2r+1)}}) under r-th-order Hölderian error bound. It outperforms existing methods in theoretical complexity and numerical experiments.",
