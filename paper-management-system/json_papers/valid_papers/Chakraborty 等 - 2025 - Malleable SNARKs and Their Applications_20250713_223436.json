    "abstract": "Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) are variants of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) in which complex statements can be proven in a compact way. SNARKs have had tremendous impact in several areas of cryptography, including verifiable computing, blockchains, and anonymous communication. A recurring concept in many applications is the concept of recursive SNARKs, in which a proof references a previous proof to show an evolved statement. In this work, we investigate malleable SNARKs, a generalization of this concept of recursion. An adaptation of the existing concept of malleable NIZKs, malleable SNARKs allow to modify SNARK proofs to show related statements, but such that such mauled proofs are indistinguishable from 'properly generated' fresh proofs of the related statement. We show how to instantiate malleable SNARKs for universal languages and relations, and give a number of applications: the first post-quantum RCCA-secure rerandomizable and updatable encryption schemes, a generic construction of reverse firewalls, and an unlinkable (i.e., computation-hiding) targeted malleable homomorphic encryption scheme.",
    "methodology": "Constructs malleable SNARKs using recursive proofs combined with adversarial one-way functions (AOWFs). Introduces AOWFs as a computational primitive to bound extraction depth while enabling derivation privacy, with a candidate implementation proven secure in the random oracle model. Applies malleable SNARKs to build cryptographic primitives via modified Naor-Yung transformations.",
    "conclusion": "Malleable SNARKs enable unbounded proof modifications with full derivation privacy, resolving limitations of recursive SNARKs. They facilitate the first post-quantum RCCA-secure rerandomizable encryption, reverse firewalls for NIZKs, updatable encryption, and unlinkable targeted malleable homomorphic encryption, addressing multiple open problems in cryptography.",
