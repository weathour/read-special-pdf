    "abstract": "We study the problem of fair sequential decision making given voter preferences. In each round, a decision rule must choose a decision from a set of alternatives where each voter reports which of these alternatives they approve. Instead of going with the most popular choice in each round, we aim for proportional representation, using axioms inspired by the multi-winner voting literature. The axioms require that every group of α% of the voters, if it agrees in every round (i.e., approves a common alternative), then those voters must approve at least α% of the decisions. A stronger version of the axioms requires that every group of α% of the voters that agrees in a β fraction of rounds must approve β·α% of the decisions. We show that three attractive voting rules satisfy axioms of this style. One of them (Sequential Phragmén) makes its decisions online, and the other two satisfy strengthened versions of the axioms but make decisions semi-online (Method of Equal Shares) or fully offline (Proportional Approval Voting). We present empirical results for these rules based on synthetic data and U.S. political elections. We also run experiments using the moral machine dataset about ethical dilemmas. We find that aggregating these votes using our rules leads to a more equal utility distribution across demographics than making decisions using a single global preference model.",
    "methodology": "Axiomatic definition of proportional representation properties (PJR, Strong PJR, EJR, Strong EJR), proposal and analysis of three voting rules (Sequential Phragmén, Method of Equal Shares, Proportional Approval Voting), theoretical impossibility proofs, and empirical evaluation using synthetic data, political election data, and the Moral Machine dataset.",
    "conclusion": "Three voting rules satisfy proportional representation axioms: Sequential Phragmén (online) satisfies Strong PJR, Method of Equal Shares (semi-online) satisfies EJR, and Proportional Approval Voting (offline) satisfies Strong EJR. Experiments demonstrate these rules achieve fairer utility distributions than baselines. Stronger axioms are impossible to satisfy generally, and online rules cannot achieve EJR.",

It defines proportionality axioms, proposes three voting rules with varying online capabilities, proves their theoretical properties, and validates them empirically.",

        "Traditional sequential decision-making (e.g., perpetual voting) often overlooks minority groups, leading to unfair outcomes where majority preferences dominate all decisions.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Defines proportionality axioms; designs three rules: Sequential Phragmén (load-balancing, online), Method of Equal Shares (budget allocation, semi-online), Proportional Approval Voting (harmonic-score maximization, offline); uses Euclidean-space synthetic data, U.S. election records, and Moral Machine dataset with Plackett-Luce preference models.",
        "Sequential Phragmén offers polynomial-time online fairness; MES balances efficiency and proportionality semi-online; PAV provides optimal offline guarantees but is NP-hard (local-search variant used).",
        "Synthetic data: Voters clustered in Euclidean space; Moral Machine: Country-specific models trained on ethical dilemmas; U.S. elections: Cast Vote Records. Data preprocessed for approval sets; representativeness validated via multiple real-world scenarios.",
        "Rigorous axiom-satisfaction proofs; metrics include average utility, 25th-percentile utility, and Gini coefficient for inequality measurement across 1000+ trials.",

      "Results": [
        "Sequential Phragmén satisfies Strong PJR online; MES satisfies EJR semi-online; PAV satisfies Strong EJR offline. All rules reduce utility inequality (lower Gini coefficients) versus Approval Voting/Round Robin in experiments.",
