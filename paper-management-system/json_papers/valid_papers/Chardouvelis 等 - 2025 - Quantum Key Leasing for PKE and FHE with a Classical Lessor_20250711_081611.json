    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the problem of secure key leasing, also known as revocable cryptography, as a strengthened security notion. This problem aims to leverage unclonable nature of quantum information to allow a lessor to lease a quantum key with reusability for evaluating a classical functionality. Later, the lessor can request the lessee to provably delete the key, depriving the lessee of evaluation capability. We construct a secure key leasing scheme for public-key homomorphic encryption from standard lattice assumptions, specifically subexponential time hardness of learning with errors. Our scheme uses classical communication between a classical lessor and quantum lessee, with classical deletion verification. The main novelty is connecting FHE to classical verification of quantumness frameworks, enabling modular construction and simpler proofs. We also develop an amplified quantum search-to-decision reduction for LWE, extracting secrets with near-perfect success probability.",
    "methodology": "The methodology involves constructing a lattice-based encryption scheme inspired by the Gentry-Sahai-Waters homomorphic encryption, modified to support quantum key leasing. Key techniques include: (1) Designing a two-key variant of Regev encryption where decryption uses quantum superpositions; (2) Integrating noisy trapdoor claw-free functions (NTCF) from classical verification of quantumness protocols for deletion certification; (3) Parallel repetition for amplified security; (4) Quantum search-to-decision reduction with noise smudging to handle auxiliary quantum states; (5) Threshold implementation measurements to test adversarial capabilities.",
    "conclusion": "The paper achieves the first secure key leasing scheme for public-key and fully homomorphic encryption with a classical lessor from standard lattice assumptions (subexponential LWE). It enables classical communication and deletion verification while ensuring that adversaries cannot retain decryption capability after deletion. The quantum search-to-decision reduction developed amplifies secret extraction success to nearly 1, a novel result for quantum adversaries with auxiliary states. This technique simplifies security proofs and has broader applications in post-quantum cryptography.",

      "Overview": "The paper presents a cryptographic construction for quantum key leasing in public-key and fully homomorphic encryption, allowing a classical entity to lease quantum decryption keys that can be provably revoked. It addresses the challenge of minimizing quantum infrastructure by eliminating quantum communication and computation requirements for the lessor, relying solely on standard lattice assumptions.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Secure key leasing leverages quantum unclonability to enable cryptographic functionalities with revocation, addressing piracy concerns in software distribution and intrusion detection. Broader challenges include the impracticality of quantum communication and the need for classical clients in real-world deployments.",
        "Prior schemes required quantum capabilities from both parties or relied on non-standard conjectures. This work solves the open problem of achieving secure leasing with a classical lessor from standard assumptions, specifically subexponential LWE hardness.",
        "The authors argue that classical lessors reduce quantum infrastructure costs and align with practical constraints where end-to-end quantum communication remains infeasible. The urgency stems from growing interest in post-quantum cryptography with minimal quantum overhead.",

Its significance lies in bridging theoretical quantum advantages with deployable systems, advancing the field beyond oracle-dependent or semi-honest models.",
