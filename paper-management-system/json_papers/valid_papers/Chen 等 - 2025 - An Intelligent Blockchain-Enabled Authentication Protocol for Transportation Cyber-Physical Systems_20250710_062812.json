    "abstract": "Transportation Cyber-Physical System (T-CPS) integrates physical transportation infrastructure with network technology and computational algorithms to enable real-time monitoring, traffic forecasting, and efficient management. However, public channel data transmission exposes T-CPS to security threats. This paper proposes a blockchain-based lightweight authentication protocol to enhance security and trustworthiness in Intelligent Transportation Systems. The protocol resists common attacks like capture and insider attacks, validated through Real-Or-Random model proofs. Efficiency evaluations confirm its lightweight nature and robustness, advancing secure communication for autonomous driving and traffic management applications.",
    "methodology": "Proposes a blockchain-based authentication protocol using elliptic curve cryptography, hash functions, and smart contracts. Employs multi-Trust Authority management in a private blockchain with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus. Includes five phases: initialization, registration, login/authentication, block construction/verification, and vehicle revocation. Security is formally verified via Real-Or-Random model.",
    "conclusion": "The protocol achieves mutual authentication, anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, and resistance to replay/impersonation attacks. It reduces computational overhead (5.0626 ms) and communication costs (2944 bits) versus existing methods while enabling efficient vehicle revocation. Blockchain integration mitigates single-point failures and enhances data integrity for vehicular networks.",
