    "abstract": "In this article we present a non-uniform reduction from rank-2 module-LIP over Complex Multiplication fields, to a variant of the Principal Ideal Problem, in some fitting quaternion algebra. This reduction is classical deterministic polynomial-time in the size of the inputs. The quaternion algebra in which we need to solve the variant of the principal ideal problem depends on the parameters of the module-LIP problem, but not on the problem's instance. Our reduction requires the knowledge of some special elements of this quaternion algebras, which is why it is non-uniform. In some particular cases, these elements can be computed in polynomial time, making the reduction uniform. This is the case for the Hawk signature scheme: we show that breaking Hawk is no harder than solving a variant of the principal ideal problem in a fixed quaternion algebra (and this reduction is uniform).",

    "conclusion": "Breaking the Hawk signature scheme is no harder than solving a variant of the Principal Ideal Problem in a fixed quaternion algebra, with a uniform reduction. This establishes a direct link between Hawk's security and the hardness of nrdPIP, though no efficient algorithm for quaternionic nrdPIP is currently known.",

      "Overview": "Presents a reduction from the rank-2 Module-Lattice Isomorphism Problem over Complex Multiplication fields to a variant of the Principal Ideal Problem in quaternion algebras, with implications for the security of the Hawk signature scheme.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The Lattice Isomorphism Problem (LIP) is a cryptographic assumption used in post-quantum schemes like Hawk. Prior work achieved superexponential complexity for LIP, and module-LIP was introduced to improve efficiency.",
        "Motivated by the need to cryptanalyze Hawk (based on module-LIP over cyclotomic fields) and bridge gaps in understanding its hardness compared to totally real fields.",
        "Argues that module-LIP may be easier than LIP due to algebraic structure, and Hawk's use of totally imaginary fields necessitates a tailored reduction to assess security urgency.",
        "Relates module-LIP to broader challenges in lattice-based cryptography by reducing it to a well-studied algebraic problem (PIP), establishing significance for post-quantum security.",
        "Contributes to cryptography, algorithmic number theory, and lattice-based cryptanalysis."
      ],
      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: (1) Module-Lattice Isomorphism Problem (finding isometries between structured lattices), (2) norm-reduced Principal Ideal Problem (computing ideal generators with given norm), (3) Quaternion algebras (non-commutative structures for arithmetic representations).",
        "Logical network: Module-LIP instances are embedded into quaternion algebras; solving nrdPIP in these algebras recovers congruence matrices for module-LIP. The reduction exploits the equivalence between geometric lattice properties and algebraic ideal properties.",
        "Key assumptions: Access to an oracle for quaternionic nrdPIP; existence of maximal orders and precomputed algebraic objects (e.g., unit groups).",
        "Contributes a theoretical equivalence proof, advancing cryptanalysis by linking module-LIP to ideal-theoretic problems in non-commutative algebras."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core method: Embeds rank-2 modules over CM fields into ideals in totally definite quaternion algebras, then reduces module-LIP to computing generators via nrdPIP. Uses polynomial-time algorithms for determinant computation and pseudo-basis operations.",
        "Novelty: First reduction of module-LIP to quaternionic PIP for CM fields. Applicable to cryptographic schemes (e.g., Hawk); rational due to explicit constructions and worst-case security implications.",
        "Data: Relies on algebraic number theory (CM fields, quaternion algebras); no empirical data. Preprocessing computes rings of integers, maximal orders, and unit groups.",
        "Rigorous via mathematical proofs; evaluation metrics include correctness of reduction and polynomial-time bounds. Lacks experimental validation but theoretically sound.",
        "Follows algebraic number theory paradigms; this choice enables module-to-ideal translations but constrains generality to quaternion algebras."

      "Results": [
        "Key result: A polynomial-time reduction from module-LIP to nrdPIP, provably correct for CM fields. For Hawk, breaking security reduces uniformly to nrdPIP in a fixed quaternion algebra.",
        "Significance: Confirms that one SVP call suffices to break Hawk (aligning with conservative security estimates). Reliability ensured by deterministic reduction; stability depends on hardness of nrdPIP in quaternion algebras."

        "Strengths: General for CM fields; mathematically rigorous. Weaknesses: Non-uniform in general (requires precomputation). Addresses rebuttals by proving uniformity for Hawk and linking to prior SVP-based attacks."

      "Strengths_and_Limitations": [
        "Strengths: First reduction for CM fields; confirms sufficiency of one SVP call for Hawk; provides foundational security insight.",

        "Theoretical constraints: Reliance on quaternion algebras limits extensions to other algebraic structures; hardness of quaternionic nrdPIP remains open."
