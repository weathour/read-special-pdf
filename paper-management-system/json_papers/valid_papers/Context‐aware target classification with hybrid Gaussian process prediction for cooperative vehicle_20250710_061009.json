    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has been proposed as a potential solution to improve the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles by improving coordination and removing the barrier of non-line-of-sight sensing. Cooperative Vehicle Safety (CVS) applications are tightly dependent on the reliability of the underneath data system, which can suffer from loss of information due to the inherent issues of their different components, such as sensor failures or the poor performance of V2X technologies under dense communication channel conditions. To enable reliable and robust CVS systems that mitigate the effect of information loss, we proposed a Context-Aware Target Classification (CA-TC) module coupled with a hybrid learning-based predictive modeling technique for CVS systems. The CA-TC consists of two modules: A Context-Aware Map (CAM), and a Hybrid Gaussian Process (HGP) prediction system. Based on offline real-world data, we learn a finite bank of driver models that represent the joint dynamics of the vehicle and the driver's behavior. We combine offline training and online model updates with on-the-fly forecasting to account for new possible driver behaviors. Finally, our framework is validated using simulation and realistic driving scenarios to confirm its potential in enhancing the robustness and reliability of CVS systems.",
    "methodology": "The research employs a Hybrid Gaussian Process (HGP) prediction system integrated with a Context-Aware Map (CAM) for trajectory forecasting. It involves offline learning of driver models from real-world datasets (SPMD, 100-Car, SUMO), online updates for new behaviors, Bayesian inference for non-parametric modeling, and indirect prediction of vehicle positions via speed and heading regression. Validation is conducted through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and controlled experiments with varying communication parameters.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed Context-Aware Target Classification module with HGP prediction significantly enhances CVS system robustness against communication losses, outperforming baselines like Kalman Filters and LSTMs in high packet error rates. It improves safety application reliability, validated across multiple datasets, though computational demands limit real-time applicability for large training windows.",
