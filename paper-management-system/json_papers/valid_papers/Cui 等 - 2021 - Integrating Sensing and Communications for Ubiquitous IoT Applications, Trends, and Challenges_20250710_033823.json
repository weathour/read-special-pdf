    "abstract": "Recent advances in wireless communication and solid-state circuits together with the enormous demands of sensing ability have given rise to a new enabling technology, integrated (radar) sensing and communication (ISAC). ISAC captures two main advantages over dedicated sensing and communication functionalities: integration gain to efficiently utilize congested wireless hardware resources, and even more interesting, coordination gain to balance dual-functional performance or and perform mutual assistance. Triggered by ISAC, we are also witnessing a paradigm shift in the ubiquitous IoT architecture, in which the sensing and communication layers are tending to partially converge into a new layer, namely, the signaling layer. In this article, we first attempt to introduce a definition of ISAC, analyze the various influencing forces, and present several novel use cases. Then we complement the understanding of the signaling layer by presenting several key benefits in the IoT era. We classify existing dominant ISAC solutions based on the layers in which integration is applied. Finally, several challenges and opportunities are identified. We hope that this overview article will serve as a primary starting point for new researchers and offer a bird's-eye view of the existing ISAC-related advances.",
    "methodology": "The paper employs a descriptive and analytical survey methodology, categorizing ISAC solutions based on integration levels (hardware, signaling, and application layers). It discusses signaling strategies such as time division, spectral division, spatial division, and fully unified waveform design, supported by existing research and use cases.",
    "conclusion": "ISAC enables a paradigm shift in IoT architecture by converging sensing and communication layers into a signaling layer, providing integration gain (e.g., hardware and spectral efficiency) and coordination gain (e.g., mutual assistance). It will play an essential role in the IoT era, with identified challenges including fundamental trade-offs and networked ISAC solutions.",
