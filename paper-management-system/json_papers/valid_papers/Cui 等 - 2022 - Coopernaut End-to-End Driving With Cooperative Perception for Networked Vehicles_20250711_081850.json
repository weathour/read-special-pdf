    "abstract": "Optical sensors and learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles have dramatically advanced, but reliability remains hindered by limited line-of-sight sensing and brittleness in extreme situations. COOPERNAUT introduces an end-to-end learning model leveraging vehicle-to-vehicle communications for vision-based cooperative driving. It encodes LiDAR data into compact point-based representations transmittable via wireless channels. Evaluated using AUTOCASTSIM (a network-augmented simulation framework with accident-prone scenarios), COOPERNAUT achieves 40% higher success rates than egocentric models while requiring 5× less bandwidth than prior work.",
    "methodology": "Uses Point Transformer to encode LiDAR point clouds into compact spatial representations. Features: 1) Local Point Encoders on each vehicle, 2) Representation Aggregator with spatial transformation and voxel max-pooling, 3) Control Module with PID speed controller. Trained via DAgger algorithm combining behavior cloning and expert-supervised online interaction.",
    "conclusion": "Cooperative perception via V2V communications significantly improves driving safety in occlusion-limited scenarios. COOPERNAUT reduces collisions by 40% while maintaining bandwidth efficiency (5.1 Mbps). Point-based representations outperform voxel-based alternatives in spatial resolution and communication efficiency.",
