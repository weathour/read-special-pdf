    "abstract": "While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually closely related and develop a framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention through decompositions of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework enables a new architecture (Mamba-2) that refines Mamba's selective SSM, achieving 2-8× speedup while remaining competitive with Transformers on language modeling.",
    "methodology": "Develops the Structured State Space Duality (SSD) framework connecting SSMs and attention via structured semiseparable matrices. Introduces SSD algorithms (recurrent linear form, dual quadratic form, hybrid block decomposition) and the Mamba-2 architecture with parallel parameter projections.",
    "conclusion": "Mamba-2, enabled by SSD, is 2-8× faster than Mamba and competitive with Transformers on language modeling. It Pareto-dominates Mamba and Transformers in perplexity and wall-clock time, demonstrating efficient linear scaling in sequence length.",
