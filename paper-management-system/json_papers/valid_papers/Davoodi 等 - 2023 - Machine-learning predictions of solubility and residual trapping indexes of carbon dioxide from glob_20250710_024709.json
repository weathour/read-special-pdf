    "abstract": "This study models the solubility trapping index (STI) and residual trapping index (RTI) of CO2 in saline aquifers by applying four robust machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Extreme learning machine (ELM), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), general regression neural network (GRNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN) are applied to 6811 compiled simulation records. The LSSVM model delivered the lowest RMSE values (0.0043 for STI and 0.0105 for RTI) and highest prediction scores, establishing it as the most credible model. Key influential variables include time elapsed (strongest for STI) and injection rate (strongest for RTI). The approach enables rapid feasibility assessments for geological CO2 storage projects.",
    "methodology": "Four ML/DL algorithms (ELM, LSSVM, GRNN, CNN) were applied to predict STI and RTI using 8 input variables (porosity, permeability, thickness, salinity, depth, residual gas saturation, injection rate, time elapsed). Data from 6811 simulation records was normalized, split 80:20 for training/testing, and evaluated using RMSE, R², and AARE metrics. Model parameters were optimized via trial-and-error sensitivity analysis.",
    "conclusion": "LSSVM outperformed other models with RMSE 0.0043 (STI) and 0.0105 (RTI). Time elapsed and injection rate were most influential for STI and RTI respectively. The framework enables efficient CO2 storage feasibility assessments without complex simulations.",
