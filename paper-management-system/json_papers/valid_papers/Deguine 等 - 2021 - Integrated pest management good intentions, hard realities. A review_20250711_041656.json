    "abstract": "Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides an illustration of how crop protection has (or has not) evolved over the past six decades. Throughout this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture, pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges. Global pesticide use has, however, largely continued unabated, with negative implications for farmer livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and the human right to food. In this review, we examine how IPM has developed over time and assess whether this concept remains suited to present-day challenges. We believe that despite many good intentions, hard realities need to be faced.",
    "methodology": "Critical literature review, historical analysis of IPM evolution, case studies of IPM implementation failures, and proposal of Agroecological Crop Protection (ACP) as an alternative paradigm. Includes interdisciplinary assessment spanning agronomy, ecology, and social sciences.",
    "conclusion": "IPM has failed to significantly reduce global pesticide use due to definitional confusion, inconsistencies between concepts and practices, insufficient farmer engagement, and inadequate ecological focus. The authors propose Agroecological Crop Protection (ACP) as a paradigm shift prioritizing ecological health, biodiversity, and preventive measures while relegating chemical control to a last-resort option.",

      "Overview": "This review critically examines the 60-year evolution of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), revealing its failure to reduce global pesticide use despite intentions. It analyzes systemic weaknesses in IPM implementation and proposes Agroecological Crop Protection (ACP) as a sustainable alternative. The research area spans crop protection, agroecology, and agricultural policy.",

        "1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Pest population management integrating multiple control tactics with minimal ecological disruption. 2.

      "Methodology": [
        "Historical analysis of IPM literature, case studies (e.g., mango/chayote in Réunion), policy evaluation (e.g., EU Directive 2009/128), and ecological modeling.",
        "Novel in synthesizing 60 years of IPM evidence; applicable to global agriculture but context-dependent; rational due to interdisciplinary triangulation.",
        "Diverse academic publications, field trial data, and institutional reports. Representativeness limited by geographic bias (stronger Global North data). Minimal preprocessing beyond thematic organization.",
        "Non-experimental review design; rigor demonstrated through systematic weakness identification. Evaluation metrics include pesticide reduction rates and agroecosystem biodiversity.",
        "Follows agroecological theoretical paradigm, emphasizing systems thinking over pest-centric approaches and influencing redesign-oriented research perspectives."

      "Results": [
        "1) Global pesticide use increased despite IPM; 2) >100 contradictory IPM definitions created confusion; 3) Chemical control remains primary in 78%+ field implementations; 4) ACP trials achieved 45-100% pesticide reduction without yield loss.",
        "Results robustly challenge IPM's efficacy via historical trends. Reliability high for documented failures; stability of ACP successes requires long-term validation."

        "Three-part structure: 1) IPM's historical failures, 2) Diagnosis of weaknesses (definitional, practical, ecological), 3) ACP as solution.",
