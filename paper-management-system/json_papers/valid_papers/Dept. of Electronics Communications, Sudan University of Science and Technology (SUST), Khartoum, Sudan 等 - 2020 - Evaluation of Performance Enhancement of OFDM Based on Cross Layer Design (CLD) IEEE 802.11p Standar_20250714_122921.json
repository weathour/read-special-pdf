    "abstract": "In recent years, Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) plays an Intelligent important Transportation Systems (ITS) due to their impact in reducing traffic jams and increasing safety. Dissemination of emergency safety messages is an important function in VANET to realize safety applications. Therefore, short delay dissemination and reliable delivery are required in between vehicles. In fact, IEEE 802.11p is an IEEE physical and MAC standard which intended specially for vehicular communications. In this VANET standard, different physical layer transmission techniques are defined. The latest researches indicate the great potential of employing OFDM for VANET safety applications. In this paper, the performance of VANET city scenario is evaluated in terms of average throughput, delay and PDR. The proposed routing approach which named by Cross Layer Design (CLD) is based on sharing information between physical (PHY) and MAC layers in order to select the best path (route). From the simulation results, we can show that our proposed approach can achieve short delay and maximum Packet Deliver Ratio (PDR) in city environment by simultaneous transmission. The achieved results confirm the best PDR for our proposed technique when there is no movement of communicating vehicles. In addition, the proposed routing approach minimizes delay and hence maximizes comparing with other conventional routing protocols. In addition, a stable behaviour of PDR values is achieved by using CLD approach.",
