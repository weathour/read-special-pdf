    "abstract": "Dedicated Lanes (DLs) have been proposed as a potential scenario for the deployment of Automated and/or Connected Vehicles (C/AVs) on the road network. However, evidence-based knowledge regarding the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency is limited. In order to develop an adequate design for DLs, first, a conceptual framework describing the relations and interrelations between these factors and traffic safety and efficiency is needed. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework accounting for the factors that could affect the safety and efficiency of DLs. This conceptual framework is underpinned based on relevant literature on how the deployment of C/AVs, driver behaviour, and DL design and operation affect traffic safety and efficiency. Based on the conceptual framework, the knowledge gaps on DL design for C/AVs were identified and a research agenda, including prioritization of the research needs, is proposed.",

    "conclusion": "The paper concludes with a research agenda emphasizing the need for specifying the vehicle types to be allowed on dedicated lanes, understanding the behavioural adaptation of drivers, and the importance of demarcations and signage. Methodological challenges include the complexity of large-scale field tests and the need for driving simulator and simulation studies.",
