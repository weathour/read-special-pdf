    "abstract": "A Random Oracle Combiner (ROC), introduced by Dodis et al. (CRYPTO 22), takes two hash functions h1, h2 from m bits to n bits and outputs a new hash function C from m' to n' bits. This function C is guaranteed to be indifferentiable from a fresh random oracle as long as one of h1 and h2 (say, h1) is a random oracle, while the other h2 can arbitrarily depend on h1. The work of Dodis et al. also built the first length-preserving ROC, where n' = n. Unfortunately, despite this feasibility result, this construction has several deficiencies. From the practical perspective, it could not be directly applied to existing Merkle-Damgård-based hash functions, such as SHA2 or SHA3. From the theoretical perspective, it required h1 and h2 to have input length m ≥ 3λ, where λ is the security parameter. To overcome these limitations, Dodis et al. conjectured and left as the main open question that the following (salted) construction is a length-preserving ROC: Ĉ^{h1,h2}_{Z1,Z2}(M) = h1^*(M, Z1) ⊕ h2^*(M, Z2), where Z1, Z2 are random salts of appropriate length, and f^* denotes the Merkle-Damgård-extension of a given compression function f. As our main result, we resolve this conjecture in the affirmative. For practical use, this makes the resulting combiner applicable to existing, Merkle-Damgård-based hash functions. On the theory side, it shows the existence of ROCs only requiring optimal input length m ≥ λ + O(1).",
    "methodology": "Proposes a Merkle-Damgård-based combiner construction and proves its security using the indifferentiability framework. The core methodology involves constructing a simulator to demonstrate indifferentiability from a random oracle, with combinatorial analysis to bound simulator runtime and security probabilities.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed Merkle-Damgård-style combiner Ĉ(M) = h1^*(M, Z1) ⊕ h2^*(M, Z2) is a secure random oracle combiner when |Z1| = |Z2| = |M| + λ. This resolves the open conjecture, achieves optimal input length m ≥ λ + O(1), and enables practical application to standard hash functions (e.g., SHA2/SHA3) without internal modifications.",

      "Overview": "The paper proposes and analyzes a Merkle-Damgård-based random oracle combiner (ROC) that securely combines two hash functions into a single hash function indifferentiable from a random oracle if at least one input function is ideal. It addresses limitations of prior ROCs by enabling direct use with standard hash functions (e.g., SHA2/SHA3) and achieving optimal input length requirements.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Research background involves cryptographic hash combiners, which aim to produce a secure hash function from two candidates where at least one is trustworthy. Broader challenges include output-length inflation in collision-resistant combiners and impracticality for real-world standards.",
        "Motivation stems from deficiencies in prior ROCs: inability to integrate with Merkle-Damgård-based functions and suboptimal input length (m ≥ 3λ). The specific problem is to build a length-preserving ROC that works with existing hash functions and minimizes m.",
        "The authors argue necessity by highlighting practical scenarios (e.g., mutually untrusted parties choosing hash standards) and theoretical gaps, emphasizing that prior solutions double output length or require impractical compression-function-level access.",
        "The problem is linked to broader challenges by showing how output-length constraints cripple applications (e.g., hash-then-sign signatures) and how Merkle-Damgård structure complicates security proofs. Significance is established via real-world applicability and optimality.",
