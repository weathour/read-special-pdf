    "abstract": "Signalized intersections play a vital role in addressing transportation efficiency and vehicle fuel economy in urban areas. With the development of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), mixed traffic environments become important for intelligent transportation systems. This paper proposes a Coupled Vehicle-Signal Control (CVSC) method to simultaneously optimize traffic signal timing and CAV trajectories, aiming to improve traffic efficiency and energy savings. Simulation results show CVSC saves 6-14% fuel consumption and increases average speed by 1-5% when CAV penetration exceeds 40%.",
    "methodology": "Proposes a two-component approach: 1) Continuous traffic signal optimization minimizing total intersection delay using fundamental diagram modeling of mixed traffic flow (HDVs and CAVs), 2) Eco-driving trajectory generation for CAVs using piecewise trigonometric functions based on planned arrival times derived from signal timing and stop-start wave analysis.",
    "conclusion": "CVSC significantly improves intersection performance in mixed traffic environments. At >40% CAV penetration, it reduces fuel consumption by 6-14% and increases average speed by 1-5%. The method outperforms traditional CACC control and GlidePath eco-driving models.",
