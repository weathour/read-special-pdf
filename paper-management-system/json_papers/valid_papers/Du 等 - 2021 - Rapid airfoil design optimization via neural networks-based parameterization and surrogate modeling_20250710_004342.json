    "abstract": "Aerodynamic optimization based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful design approach because it significantly reduces the design time compared with human manual design. However, CFD-based optimization can still take hours to converge due to computationally expensive flow simulations. To further shorten the design optimization time, we propose a fast, interactive design framework that completes airfoil aerodynamic optimization within seconds. This framework uses a B-spline-based generative adversarial network (BSplineGAN) for shape parameterization to filter out unrealistic airfoils and reduce the design space. Additionally, we employ a combination of multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural networks, and mixture of experts for surrogate modeling to predict scalar (drag, lift) and vector (pressure distribution) responses across Mach numbers (0.3–0.7) and Reynolds numbers (10^4–10^10). Verification shows optimal designs and aerodynamic quantities from our framework align closely with direct CFD-based optimizations. The framework is being integrated into a web-based interactive aerodynamic design tool.",

    "conclusion": "The proposed framework achieves airfoil optimization within seconds, with results agreeing closely with direct CFD-based optimizations. BSplineGAN effectively reduces the design space while maintaining realistic airfoils, and neural network surrogates accurately predict aerodynamic responses across subsonic and transonic regimes. The approach enables real-time interactive design.",
