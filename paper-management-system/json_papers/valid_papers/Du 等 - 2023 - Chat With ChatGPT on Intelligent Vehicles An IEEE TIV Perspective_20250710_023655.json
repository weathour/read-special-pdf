    "abstract": "This letter reports on a TIV DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) that explores the prospective influence of ChatGPT on research and development in intelligent vehicles. To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in responses. We discuss potential applications of ChatGPT in autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities. Technical questions regarding training methods for intelligent vehicles and human-machine shared control are addressed.",
    "methodology": "Conducted a decentralized hybrid workshop (DHW) with IEEE TIV editors; designed and administered basic/technical questions to ChatGPT; analyzed response accuracy, update capabilities, and limitations; discussed conceptual applications.",
    "conclusion": "ChatGPT shows potential for intelligent vehicle applications but has significant limitations in information timeliness, consistency, and reliability. Integration presents opportunities in driver assistance and autonomous systems but requires addressing privacy, security, and technical challenges.",
