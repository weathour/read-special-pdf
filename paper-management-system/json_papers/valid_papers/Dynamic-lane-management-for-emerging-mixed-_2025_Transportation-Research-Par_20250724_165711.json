    "abstract": "Semi-autonomous vehicles (semi-AVs), situated between fully-autonomous vehicles (full-AVs) and traditional vehicles (TVs), offer functionalities that allow drivers to activate autonomous driving features. These functionalities, such as Tesla Autopilot, BMW Personal Pilot, and General Motors Super Cruise, relieve drivers at the wheel of certain driving tasks and are anticipated to enhance road capacity by improving driving efficiency. However, the immaturity of early-stage autonomous driving technology can hinder immediate improvements in road capacity, especially in scenarios with a mix traffic of manually and autonomously driven vehicles. To mitigate these challenges, this study introduces the use of dedicated lanes and designs an intelligent corridor system that dynamically optimizes the allocation of lanes for auto-driven and human-driven vehicles. Firstly, a congestion model is established to capture the dynamics of bottleneck congestion and derive vehicle delays with demand changes, serving as a valuable reference for developing lane management strategies. Then, the choice of driving mode for semi-AVs is bounded with lane selection and modeled using a dynamic user equilibrium model over discrete-time series. Based on that, numbers of auto-driven and human-driven lanes are dynamically optimized with the objective of minimizing system costs.",
    "methodology": "The study employs a dynamic lane congestion model to analyze vehicle delays with changes in demand. A non-myopic lane management method is developed under a rolling horizon control framework, optimizing the allocation of lanes for auto-driven and human-driven vehicles to minimize system costs.",
    "conclusion": "Dynamic lane management outperforms fixed-lane scenarios and static lane management in all test scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in traffic efficiency and reduction in delays. The approach is particularly effective in the initial stages of AV adoption, offering a promising solution for efficient lane management in mixed traffic environments.",
