    "abstract": "We introduce a method to generate 3D scenes that are disentangled into their component objects. This disentanglement is unsupervised, relying only on the knowledge of a large pretrained text-to-image model. Our key insight is that objects can be discovered by finding parts of a 3D scene that, when rearranged spatially, still produce valid configurations of the same scene. Concretely, our method jointly optimizes multiple NeRFs from scratch each representing its own object along with a set of layouts that composite these objects into scenes. We then encourage these composited scenes to be in-distribution according to the image generator. We show that despite its simplicity, our approach successfully generates 3D scenes decomposed into individual objects, enabling new capabilities in text-to-3D content creation.",
    "methodology": "Joint optimization of multiple Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) representing individual objects and sets of layouts (3D affine transformations) that composite objects into scenes. Uses Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) from a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., Imagen) for supervision. Incorporates per-NeRF regularization losses (e.g., empty NeRF penalty) and learns multiple layouts to enforce object consistency across arrangements.",
    "conclusion": "Layout learning enables unsupervised disentanglement of 3D scenes into individual objects, facilitating text-to-3D generation with object-level control. The approach outperforms baselines in decomposition quality and supports applications like scene editing and asset arrangement without additional supervision.",
