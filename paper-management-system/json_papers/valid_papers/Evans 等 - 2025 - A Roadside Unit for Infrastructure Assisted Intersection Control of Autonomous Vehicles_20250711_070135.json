    "abstract": "Recent advances in autonomous vehicle technologies and cellular network speeds motivate developments in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. Enhanced road safety features and improved fuel efficiency are some of the motivations behind V2X for future transportation systems. Adaptive intersection control systems have considerable potential to achieve these goals by minimizing idle times and predicting short-term future traffic conditions. Integrating V2X into traffic management systems introduces the infrastructure necessary to make roads safer for all users and initiates the shift towards more intelligent and connected cities. To demonstrate our control algorithm, we implement both a simulated and real-world representation of a 4-way intersection and crosswalk scenario with 2 self-driving electric vehicles, a roadside unit (RSU), and a traffic light. Our architecture reduces acceleration and braking through intersections by up to 75.35%, which has been shown to minimize fuel consumption in gas vehicles. We propose a cost-effective solution to intelligent and connected intersection control to serve as a proof-of-concept model suitable as the basis for continued research and development. Code for this project is available at https://github.com/MMachado05/REU-2024.",
    "methodology": "The methodology includes simulation using GazelleSim for initial testing, real-world implementation with autonomous electric vehicles (ACTor) equipped with sensors (e.g., LiDAR, GPS), a ROS-based software architecture for modular control, and an adaptive speed algorithm that calculates target velocity using GPS waypoints and the Cosine-Haversine formula to synchronize vehicle approach with traffic light states and avoid idling.",
    "conclusion": "The paper proposes a cost-effective V2X teaching model for adaptive intersection control that reduces acceleration and braking by up to 75.35%, minimizing fuel consumption and idling. It utilizes a low-cost roadside unit for wireless communication, demonstrated through simulation and real-world tests. Future work includes implementing fail-operational states for connection losses and enhancing scalability.",

        "Addresses pedestrian safety risks at crosswalks and fuel inefficiency due to idling in traffic systems.",
        "Motivated by the need for cost-effective, real-world deployable solutions for V2X intersection control, as existing approaches are simulation-only, costly, or ignore deployment expenses.",
        "Authors argue necessity by citing high pedestrian injury rates (e.g., up to 60% in cities like Montreal) and gaps in research, such as the lack of field testing and scalability limitations.",

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: (1) V2X Communications - exchange of information between vehicles and infrastructure; (2) Roadside Unit (RSU) - a low-cost hardware unit for wireless communication; (3) Adaptive Speed Control - algorithm to adjust vehicle velocity based on traffic light states.",
        "Logical relationships: The RSU communicates traffic light states to vehicles via V2X; vehicles use this data with GPS waypoints in the adaptive algorithm to calculate target velocity, reducing stops and optimizing intersection crossing.",
        "Key assumptions: Vehicles are autonomous and equipped with sensors; communication is reliable; environments are controlled and low-speed; and traffic light states are predictable.",
        "The paper makes a practical contribution by providing a cost-effective, educational proof-of-concept model that advances V2X applications in real-world settings, rather than theoretical innovation."

      "Methodology": [
        "Uses GazelleSim for lightweight simulation, real-world testing with Polaris Gem e2 electric vehicles and ROS architecture, and an adaptive speed algorithm based on GPS waypoints and kinematics equations.",
        "Novelty lies in using Wi-Fi instead of conventional cmWave for cost efficiency; applicability is high for educational tools but limited to controlled environments; rationality is supported by experimental validation against human drivers.",
        "Data sources include manually recorded GPS waypoints from a test course, with preprocessing for distance calculations; representativeness is low as data is from a small-scale, controlled setting, not high-traffic urban scenarios.",
        "Experimental design compares adaptive algorithm performance against human drivers across different light state configurations, with metrics like acceleration reduction and average velocity; rigor is adequate for proof-of-concept but lacks statistical robustness or diverse conditions.",
