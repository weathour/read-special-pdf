    "abstract": "Cooperative vehicle safety systems (CVSSs) rely on vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) for delivering critical vehicle tracking information. This paper analyzes the effect of transmission range and rate on VANET performance in highway scenarios, heavily affected by hidden node interference. We develop models quantifying network performance via channel occupancy as a feedback measure for successful information dissemination. These findings enable robust transmission range adaptation schemes.",
    "methodology": "Developed three interconnected Markov Chain models: 1) Backoff process and packet waiting, 2) Overlapping hidden node transmissions, 3) Minislot state observation. Integrated PHY layer packet error rate (PER) models. Validated via discrete-event simulations in OPNET/SHIFT.",
    "conclusion": "Channel occupancy (busy ratio) reliably indicates Information Dissemination Rate (IDR) success. Optimal IDR occurs near 0.65 occupancy. Robust transmission range adaptation using occupancy feedback maintains near-peak IDR across varying traffic densities, improving CVSS tracking accuracy.",
