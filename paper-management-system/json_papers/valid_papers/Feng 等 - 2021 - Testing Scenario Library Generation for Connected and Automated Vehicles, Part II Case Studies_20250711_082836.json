    "abstract": "Testing scenario library generation (TSLG) is a critical step for the development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). In Part I of this study, a general method for TSLG is proposed, and theoretical properties are investigated regarding the accuracy and efﬁciency of CAV evaluation. This paper aims to provide implementation examples and guidelines, and to enhance the proposed methodology under high-dimensional scenarios. Three typical cases, including cut-in, highway-exit, and car-following, are designed and studied in this paper. For each case, the process of library generation and CAV evaluation is elaborated. To address the challenges brought by high dimensionality, the proposed method is further enhanced by reinforcement learning technique. For all three cases, results show that the proposed method can accelerate the CAV evaluation process by multiple magnitudes with same evaluation accuracy, if compared with the on-road test method.",
    "methodology": "The methodology involves generating testing scenario libraries using scenario criticality (a combination of maneuver challenge and exposure frequency). For low-dimensional cases, it employs multi-start optimization and seed-fill based searching. For high-dimensional scenarios, it integrates temporal-difference reinforcement learning (TD-RL) to handle computational complexity. Naturalistic driving data (NDD) analysis is used for exposure frequency, and surrogate models (e.g., Intelligent Driving Model for car-following) simulate CAV behavior. Case studies include cut-in (safety evaluation), highway-exit (functionality evaluation), and car-following (high-dimensional safety evaluation).",
    "conclusion": "The proposed method significantly accelerates CAV evaluation compared to on-road testing, with speedups of 1888x for cut-in, 255x for highway-exit, and 375,000x for car-following cases, while maintaining the same accuracy. It handles various performance metrics (safety and functionality) and high-dimensional scenarios effectively. Limitations include dependence on surrogate model similarity to actual CAVs and the need for large-scale NDD.",

      "Overview": "This paper presents case studies implementing a general framework for testing scenario library generation (TSLG) for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), extending Part I. It focuses on practical guidelines and enhancements for high-dimensional scenarios using reinforcement learning, covering cut-in, highway-exit, and car-following cases to evaluate safety and functionality.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The research addresses broader challenges in CAV testing, such as inefficiencies in handling diverse scenario types, varying CAV models, and multiple performance metrics (e.g., safety and functionality). Existing methods are limited to low-dimensional scenarios or specific metrics.",
        "Motivation stems from the need to accelerate CAV evaluation while ensuring statistical accuracy, particularly for high-dimensional scenarios where computational complexity (the 'curse of dimensionality') hinders traditional approaches.",
        "The authors argue for urgency by highlighting the rarity of critical events (e.g., accidents) in naturalistic driving data, which makes on-road testing impractical and costly. They emphasize that current methods overemphasize worst-case scenarios, neglecting real-world exposure frequency.",
        "The specific problem of TSLG is linked to broader CAV deployment challenges by demonstrating how efficient evaluation reduces development time and cost. This establishes significance for safe and timely CAV integration into transportation systems.",
        "This paper contributes to intelligent transportation systems, automotive engineering, and interdisciplinary fields involving machine learning (reinforcement learning) and statistical evaluation."
      ],
      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: 1) Scenario Criticality: Defined as P(S|x,θ)P(x|θ), combining maneuver challenge (probability of event S with a surrogate model) and exposure frequency (probability from naturalistic data). 2) Task Difficulty: For functionality evaluation, measured as the area of feasible solutions (e.g., lane-change zones). 3) Reinforcement Learning Integration: Formulates high-dimensional TSLG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to compute state-action values.",
        "Logical relationships: Scenario criticality drives library generation; task difficulty extends it to functionality; RL integration enables scalability. Criticality depends on exposure frequency (from NDD) and maneuver challenge (from surrogate models), with task difficulty providing a specialized metric for functionality.",
        "Key assumptions: Surrogate models (e.g., IDM) accurately represent generic CAV behavior; the Markov property holds for high-dimensional state transitions; naturalistic driving data is representative of real-world exposure; and optimization techniques efficiently locate critical scenarios.",
        "The paper makes a methodological contribution by providing a unified framework for TSLG that advances the field's knowledge system through theoretical extensions (e.g., RL enhancement) and practical validation, improving evaluation efficiency and versatility."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include criticality-based optimization with multi-start and seed-fill searching for low-dimensional cases, and TD-RL for high-dimensional scenarios. Auxiliary objective functions guide searches (e.g., minimal normalized positive ETTC for safety), while NDD analysis calibrates exposure frequency and surrogate models.",
        "The methodology is novel in integrating RL to handle dimensionality, applicable across scenarios and metrics. Rationality is supported by theoretical proofs (e.g., convergence of Q-values) and case studies showing statistical accuracy.",
        "Data sources: Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) for cut-in and car-following cases; Integrated Vehicle-Based Safety System (IVBSS) for highway-exit. Data characteristics include vehicle trajectories, speeds, and accelerations. Preprocessing involves event extraction (e.g., cut-ins via lateral distance thresholds) and discretization. Representativeness is evaluated as high due to large-scale, real-world datasets.",
        "Experimental design uses case studies with controlled variables (e.g., range, range rate for cut-in) and metrics like accident rate and task failure rate. Evaluation rigor is high, with statistical precision criteria (e.g., relative half-width <0.3) and comparisons to on-road testing baselines. Metrics are adequate, covering safety (accidents) and functionality (task completion).",
        "The research follows a systems engineering and statistical evaluation paradigm, influenced by reinforcement learning theory. This perspective emphasizes optimization and probabilistic modeling, focusing on efficiency and scalability in scenario generation."

      "Results": [
        "Key results: Acceleration factors of 1888x (cut-in), 255x (highway-exit), and 375,000x (car-following) compared to on-road testing; all cases achieved target estimation precision (e.g., β≤0.3 for cut-in) with minimal tests (e.g., 51 tests for cut-in vs. 96,300 for baseline).",
        "Results are significant for enabling faster CAV validation, reliable due to convergence in statistical estimates (e.g., Fig. 6,8,12), and stable across cases as shown by consistent speedups. Reliability is underpinned by theoretical guarantees from Part I and empirical validation."

Logical links include using case studies to demonstrate generality and RL to resolve dimensionality.",
        "Strengths: Clear, step-by-step logic with theoretical backing; addresses rebuttals (e.g., dissimilarity issue) via discussion of limitations. Weaknesses include limited justification for surrogate model choices; authors mitigate by proposing adaptive updates in future work."
