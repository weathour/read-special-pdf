    "abstract": "This document provides an overall overview of the ongoing work in the Route 25 project, focusing on the support provided by mobile network communications for deploying Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) applications. By emphasizing the existing 5G and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure, the paper explores a range of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) use cases targeted by the project. The focal point is on the architectural considerations essential for enabling the MEC Federation (MECF) to support the project’s distinct V2X scenarios effectively. The manuscript concludes with an insightful analysis of research and technical challenges, offering valuable contributions to the evolving field of V2X communication in the context of MECF.",
    "methodology": "Architectural design and analysis based on ETSI MEC standards, use case exploration, and requirements gathering from industry specifications (ETSI, 5GAA, GSMA). Proposes high-level architecture with three layers (Application, Network Service, Infrastructure) and business relationship models for MECF.",
    "conclusion": "MECF enables seamless cooperation between Mobile Network Operators for V2X scenarios. The proposed architecture addresses specific Route 25 use cases but faces implementation challenges due to limited open-source solutions compliant with ETSI standards. Future validation through Proof-of-Concept implementations is needed.",
