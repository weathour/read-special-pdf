    "abstract": "To investigate how setting up connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) dedicated lanes can maximize the traffic capacity, this article proposes a fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow with CAVs dedicated lanes, in which CAVs dedicated lanes only allow CAVs and shared lanes allow both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). First, for CAVs overflowing and not overflowing, the car-following (CF) modes and their proportion in CAVs dedicated lanes and shared lanes are analyzed, respectively. Second, based on steady-state conditions and average time headway, the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow with and without CAVs dedicated lanes is derived. Then, the relevant properties of the fundamental diagram with CAVs dedicated lanes are proposed and proved. Finally, multiple parameters, such as the overflow ratio of CAVs, the penetration rate of CAVs, and the number of CAVs dedicated lanes, are adopted to discuss their impact on the fundamental diagram. Results show that: 1) one and two CAVs dedicated lanes of three manual lanes can maximize the traffic capacity when the penetration rate of CAVs reaches 0.16 and 0.31, respectively; 2) compared with C-H policy, C-S policy can maximize the traffic capacity when the penetration rate of CAVs reaches 0.45 with one CAVs dedicated lane and 0.73 with two CAVs dedicated lanes; and 3) the traffic capacity of C-S policy is up to 1.3 times and 1.6 times that of mixed traffic flow with one and two CAVs dedicated lanes of three manual lanes, respectively. This work provides insights into the impact of CAVs dedicated lanes on traffic systems and helps decide the optimal number of dedicated lanes.",
    "methodology": "The study uses the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to describe car-following behavior, analyzes different CF modes, and derives the fundamental diagram based on steady-state conditions and average time headway. Numerical simulations and theoretical modeling are employed.",
    "conclusion": "The study concludes that setting CAVs dedicated lanes can maximize traffic capacity under specific penetration rates. The C-S policy outperforms the C-H policy at higher penetration rates, and traffic capacity increases with the number of dedicated lanes and CAVs penetration rate.",
