    "abstract": "VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Network) is a significant term in ITS (intelligent transportation systems). VANETs are also mentioned as ITN (intelligent transportation Networks), which are used to enhance road safety in growing technology. The connectivity of nodes is a challenging one because of its high mobility and the sparse network connectivity must be handled properly during its initial deployment of a VANET for avoiding accidents. Quality of service (QoS) in VANET becomes a significant term because of its increasing dare about unique features, like poor link quality, high mobility, and inadequate transporting distance. Routing is the foremost issue in the wireless ad hoc network, which is used to transmit data packets significantly. This paper provides a crucial review of the classification of existing QoS routing protocols, cross-layer design approach and classification, and various performance parameters used in QoS routing protocols. The corresponding cross-layer protocols are overviewed, followed by the major techniques in cross-layer protocol design. Moreover, VANET is presented with many exclusive networking research challenges in precise areas such as security, QoS, mobility, effective channel utilization, and scalability. Finally, the paper concluded by various comparison discussion, issues, and challenges of several routing protocols for VANET. No. of publications over the period from 2010 to 2019 in various scientific sources also showed in this review. This survey provided the technical direction for researchers on routing protocols for VANET using QoS.",
    "methodology": "Comprehensive literature review and comparative analysis of existing QoS routing protocols (topology-based, cluster-based, position-based, geocast, trust-based, infrastructure-based) and cross-layer designs in VANETs, including classification frameworks and performance evaluations.",
    "conclusion": "VANETs face unique challenges requiring specialized QoS routing protocols and cross-layer optimizations. Key open issues include handling high mobility, sparse connectivity, security vulnerabilities, and scalability limitations. Future research should focus on adaptive protocols and enhanced cross-layer integration.",
