    "abstract": "The proliferation of Connected Vehicles and their ability to collect a large amount of data presents an opportunity for the real-time safety optimization of traffic networks. This study proposes a Signal-Vehicle Coupled Control (SVCC) system incorporating Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) and speed advisories to optimize safety in real-time. By applying a rule-based approach in conjunction with a Soft-Actor Critic RL framework, the system assigns speed advisories to platoons of vehicles on each approach and extends the current signal time accordingly. The system was tested on two different intersections modeled using real-world data through VISSIM. Traffic conflicts were reduced by 41-55%, and vehicle delay was reduced by 21-24%. The system functions effectively even at lower market penetration rates (MPR), with diminishing returns beyond 50% MPR.",
    "methodology": "Hybrid dynamic programming-reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic framework) for joint optimization of signal timing and speed advisories, using real-time connected vehicle data to estimate conflict rates via safety performance functions. Platoon-based trajectory optimization combined with adaptive signal control.",
    "conclusion": "The SVCC system reduces rear-end conflicts by 41-55% and vehicle delay by 21-24% at signalized intersections. It remains effective at low market penetration rates (25-50% MPR) with diminishing returns beyond 50% MPR, demonstrating computational efficiency and real-world applicability.",
