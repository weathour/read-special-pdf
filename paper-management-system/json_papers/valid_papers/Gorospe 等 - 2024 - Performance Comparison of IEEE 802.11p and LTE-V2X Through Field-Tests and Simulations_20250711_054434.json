    "abstract": "Vehicular communication is a key enabler in making Automated Vehicles (AVs) collaborate by sharing information, which complements on-board sensor information and facilitates precise vehicle control. This paper presents a tailored measurement campaign aimed at analyzing the performance of two vehicular communication technologies, namely IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X. Our study focuses on key metrics for cooperating AVs, such as end-to-end latency and packet delivery ratios. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of channel coexistence, assessing the challenges associated with concurrent channel access. The results derived from field tests are correlated with simulations conducted on PLEXE and OpenCV2X, platforms used for simulating IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X, respectively. This combined methodology, comprising field tests and simulations, enables the attainment of replicable conclusions, which in turn enables better design choices.",
    "methodology": "Conducted field tests with two vehicles equipped with IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X devices in platooning scenarios under Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. Integrated OpenCV2X into the PLEXE simulation framework to replicate field test scenarios, using OMNeT++, INET, SUMO, and Veins. Varied parameters such as modulation schemes, transmission power, packet sizes, and inter-vehicle distances. Measured Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and end-to-end latency, with simulations validated against field test results.",
    "conclusion": "IEEE 802.11p maintains significantly lower and more consistent latency than LTE-V2X, making it better suited for safety-critical applications requiring local cooperation. LTE-V2X offers broader coverage and higher reliability in NLOS scenarios but suffers from higher latency. Coexistence on the same channel degrades IEEE 802.11p performance due to unfair channel access. Simulation results from PLEXE and OpenCV2X are consistent with field tests, validating their use for performance comparisons.",

      "Overview": "The paper compares the performance of IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X communication technologies for vehicular networks, focusing on end-to-end latency and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) through field tests and simulations. It evaluates their efficacy in enabling cooperative automated vehicles under various configurations and assesses challenges in channel coexistence.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Vehicular communication is critical for automated vehicle safety, requiring low latency and high reliability. Broader challenges include selecting appropriate technologies for local cooperation and managing spectrum sharing.",
        "Motivation stems from the need to determine which technology performs better under different conditions (e.g., range, packet size) and to address the lack of real-world coexistence studies.",
        "The authors argue for necessity by citing literature gaps, such as insufficient validation of simulations and absence of coexistence tests, which are urgent for deploying reliable AV systems.",
        "They relate the specific problem to broader safety challenges in AVs, emphasizing that performance metrics directly impact collision avoidance and coordination.",
        "Contributions span vehicular networking, wireless communications, and simulation-based validation, with interdisciplinary relevance to transportation systems."

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: IEEE 802.11p (uses EDCA/CSMA-CA for channel access), LTE-V2X Mode 4 (uses SPS for scheduling), and key metrics (PDR, end-to-end latency).",
        "Logical relationships: Both technologies aim for reliable communication but differ in access mechanisms—802.11p relies on channel sensing, while LTE-V2X uses pre-scheduling. Coexistence causes interference due to incompatible access methods.",
        "Key assumptions: Real-world conditions (e.g., LOS/NLOS) are replicable in simulations; commercial devices accurately represent technology performance; GNSS synchronization ensures timing accuracy.",
        "The paper contributes empirical validation and simulation integration, advancing practical knowledge in vehicular communications by confirming trade-offs between latency and coverage."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include field tests with vehicles in platooning scenarios and simulations using integrated PLEXE-OpenCV2X framework. Parameters varied: modulation schemes (QPSK, 16QAM), transmission power (5 dBm, 20 dBm), packet sizes (200-1000 bytes), and distances (15-90 m).",
        "Methodology is novel for combining real-world measurements with simulations to ensure reproducibility; applicable to AV communication studies but limited by scenario simplicity (two vehicles). Rationality is supported by repeated tests and statistical robustness (100 simulation runs).",
        "Data from field tests used commercial OBUs with GNSS-synchronized logs; simulations employed SUMO for traffic modeling and Nakagami fading/path loss models. Data representativeness is evaluated as high for controlled environments but may lack generalizability to denser traffic.",
        "Experimental design is rigorous with controlled variables and replication; evaluation metrics (PDR, latency CDF) are adequate for safety-critical apps but could include more metrics like throughput.",
        "The research follows wireless communication standards (IEEE, 3GPP), influencing a focus on protocol-specific performance rather than theoretical innovations."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Key results: IEEE 802.11p achieves lower latency (e.g., ~4 ms in LOS) than LTE-V2X (60-100 ms). LTE-V2X shows higher PDR in NLOS. Coexistence degrades 802.11p performance (latency increase to 11 ms, PDR drop to 52%). Simulations closely match field tests.",
        "Results are significant for guiding technology selection in AVs: 802.11p excels in low-latency needs, LTE-V2X in range. Reliability is high in controlled tests but stability may vary in real-world congestion."
