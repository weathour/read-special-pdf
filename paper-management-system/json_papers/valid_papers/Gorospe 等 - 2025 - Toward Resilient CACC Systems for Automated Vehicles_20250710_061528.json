    "abstract": "Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) utilizes Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications and onboard sensors to facilitate cooperative maneuvering among automated vehicles. However, wireless communication is susceptible to transient outages due to packet losses, impacting safety and stability. This paper proposes a resilient CACC (rCACC) that uses information from the closest available neighbors during outages and a predictive CACC (pCACC) employing machine learning to estimate accelerations. Simulations demonstrate significant improvements in safety, string stability, and fuel efficiency without altering communication topologies or increasing message transmissions.",
    "methodology": "Proposed rCACC and pCACC algorithms; simulation-based evaluation using PLEXE (integrated with OMNeT++, SUMO, and Veins); Linear Regression and LSTM neural networks for prediction; varied scenarios including string size, traffic density, beacon intervals, and outage thresholds.",
    "conclusion": "rCACC effectively mitigates communication outages by leveraging alternative information sources, significantly enhancing safety and string stability. pCACC shows potential but performance depends on ML model accuracy. Both approaches maintain fuel efficiency without requiring topology changes or performance degradation.",
