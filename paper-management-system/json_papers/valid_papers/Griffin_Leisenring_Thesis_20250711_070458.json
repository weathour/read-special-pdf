    "abstract": "Automated vehicle testing in real-world driving scenarios is required for system development but may not always be performed due to safety concerns. Testing scenarios can be replicated at closed test tracks or through simulated environments using complete digital replicas of real-world roads. This thesis covers the initialization of an automated driving platform (Autoware/ROS), creation of a digital replica for a selected test route using tools like OpenStreetMap and Unity, and validation of automated driving features in simulation environments like SVL Simulator. The research aims to validate energy-saving functionalities for a Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicle within the ARPA-E NEXTCAR program.",
    "methodology": "Utilized Robot Operating System (ROS) with Autoware for sensor/module communication. Created digital route replicas via OpenStreetMap, MathWorks RoadRunner, and Unity. Validated automated driving through ROSBag playback (LiDAR point cloud localization) and SVL Simulator virtual testing.",
    "conclusion": "Simulated testing environments enable safe validation of automated driving functionality as a precursor to physical implementation. Accurate digital replicas of real-world routes can be created using open-source tools, allowing performance evaluation of autonomous features like localization and motion planning.",
