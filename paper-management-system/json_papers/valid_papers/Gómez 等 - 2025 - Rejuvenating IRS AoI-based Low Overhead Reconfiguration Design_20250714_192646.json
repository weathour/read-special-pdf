    "abstract": "Intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technologies help mitigate undesirable effects in wireless links by steering the communication signal between transmitters and receivers. IRS elements are configured to adjust the phase of the reflected signal for a user's location and enhance the perceived signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this way, an IRS improves the communication link but inevitably introduces more communication overhead. This occurs especially in mobile scenarios, where the user's position must be frequently estimated to re-adjust the IRS elements periodically. Such an operation requires balancing the amount of training versus the data time slots to optimize the communication performance in the link. Aiming to study this balance with the age of information (AoI) framework, we address the question of how often an IRS needs to be updated with the lowest possible overhead and the maximum of freshness of information. We derive the corresponding analytical solution for a mobile scenario, where the transmitter is static and the mobile user (MU) follows a random waypoint mobility model. We provide a closed-form expression for the average peak age of information (PAoI), as a metric to evaluate the impact of the IRS update frequency. As for the performance evaluation, we consider a realistic scenario following the IEEE 802.11ad standard, targeting the mmWave band. Our results reveal that the minimum achievable average PAoI is in the microsecond range and the optimal IRS update period is in the seconds range, causing 9% overhead in the link when the MU moves at a velocity of 1 m/s.",
    "methodology": "The paper employs a Markov regenerative process (MRGP) to model the dynamic behavior of an IRS-assisted link, accounting for MU mobility and the underlying transmission scheme. It formulates the trade-off between performance and overhead in an AoI-based framework, deriving analytical expressions to evaluate the minimum of the average PAoI metric.",
    "conclusion": "The paper presents a methodology to evaluate the optimal update period for IRS elements in mobile scenarios using an average PAoI framework. This methodology allows for a reconfiguration design with low overhead, balancing the impact of overhead and MU mobility. The optimal update period is in the seconds range, with the minimum information freshness in the order of hundreds of microseconds.",
