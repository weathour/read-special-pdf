    "abstract": "In this survey, we provide an extensive overview of V2X ecosystem. We also review main security privacy issues, current standardization activities and existing defense mechanisms proposed within the V2X domain. We then identified semantic gaps of existing security solutions and outline possible open issues.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and analysis of over 150 papers from major online archives (Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library) published from 1994 to 2019, focusing on classification of security threats, detection mechanisms, and standardization efforts in V2X communications.",
    "conclusion": "Securing V2X communication platforms is crucial due to vulnerabilities like DoS, Sybil, and false data injection attacks; the survey identifies gaps in existing solutions and emphasizes the need for layered defenses, practical testing, and addressing infrastructure trust issues for future deployment.",

      "Overview": "The paper is a comprehensive survey on securing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication platforms, covering technologies, security threats, standardization activities, and defense mechanisms, with a focus on misbehavior detection in vehicular networks.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Modern vehicular networks facilitate intelligent transportation but face security and privacy challenges due to vulnerabilities in automotive communication, where breaches can lead to data loss, component failure, and infrastructure damage.",
        "The motivation is to address the absence of a comprehensive summary of V2X security challenges, standardization, and solutions, specifically targeting threats like false data injection and insider attacks.",
        "The authors argue for necessity and urgency by highlighting that attacks (e.g., false accident reports) can cause real-world harm like collisions or traffic disruptions, endangering safety and hindering V2X adoption.",
        "The specific problem of V2X security is related to broader challenges in intelligent transportation systems, such as ensuring traffic efficiency and safety, and is established as significant due to the critical role of V2X in reducing incidents and pollution.",
        "This paper contributes to cybersecurity, vehicular networks, and intelligent transportation systems, with interdisciplinary relevance to communication protocols and automotive engineering."
      ],
      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts include: (1) V2X communication (vehicle-to-everything interfaces enabling data exchange), (2) PKI (public key infrastructure for authentication and integrity), and (3) misbehavior detection (identifying malicious entities transmitting incorrect data).",
        "The logical relationship network shows PKI underpinning secure communication, while misbehavior detection mechanisms build upon PKI to identify and mitigate threats; together, they form a defense-in-depth strategy for V2X security.",
        "Key assumptions include: RSUs (road-side units) are generally trusted, attackers may have valid credentials (internal threats), and vehicles follow predictable behavioral patterns for detection algorithms.",
        "The paper makes a knowledge contribution by providing a taxonomy of threats and detection methods, synthesizing existing research to identify gaps and propose future directions, thus advancing the field's systematic understanding."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods involve categorizing attacks (e.g., DoS, Sybil, false data injection) and reviewing detection approaches (e.g., entity-centric like trust-based and behavioral, data-centric like plausibility and consistency checks), with technical analysis of standards like IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI-ITS.",
        "The methodology is rational for a survey, as it systematically classifies and evaluates existing work; applicability is high for V2X security design, but novelty is limited to synthesis rather than new techniques, and some solutions may lack scalability.",
        "Data sources include academic papers from 1994-2019, crawled from Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library; preprocessing excluded non-V2X papers (e.g., general sensor networks), and representativeness is evaluated as comprehensive but potentially biased towards published literature.",
        "The research design is qualitative and non-experimental, focusing on categorization; evaluation metrics include rigor in threat classification and solution analysis, but adequacy is limited by reliance on prior studies without new empirical validation.",
        "The research follows cybersecurity and networking paradigms, emphasizing cryptographic and intrusion detection perspectives, which shapes the focus on protocol-level threats and defenses but may overlook broader system-level vulnerabilities."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Key results include: classification of V2X threats (e.g., DoS, Sybil attacks), taxonomy of detection mechanisms (proactive like PKI and reactive like trust-based schemes), and identification of open issues (e.g., infrastructure vulnerabilities).",
        "Results are significant for informing V2X security practices, reliable due to extensive literature coverage, and stable across discussed scenarios, but reliability may be affected by potential gaps in real-world validation."
      ],
      "Argumentation_and_Logic": [
        "The argument structure begins with a V2X overview, progresses to security threats and detection methods, reviews standardization, and concludes with open issues, building a case for comprehensive security measures.",
        "Key steps: define V2X technologies, outline threats using attacker models, categorize detection approaches, analyze standards, and identify gaps; logical links connect threats to defenses via empirical examples from literature.",
        "Strengths include coherent synthesis of diverse sources; weaknesses are potential oversimplification of complex attacks. The authors address rebuttals by acknowledging limitations (e.g., assumption of trusted RSUs) and suggesting hybrid detection for robustness."
      ],
      "Strengths_and_Limitations": [
        "Strengths include a detailed taxonomy of threats and defenses, thorough coverage of standardization, and identification of research gaps; innovations lie in classifying misbehavior detection mechanisms.",
        "Limitations include the assumption of trusted infrastructure (e.g., RSUs), boundaries in methodology not covering all attack vectors (e.g., intra-vehicle attacks minimally), and reliance on literature without new experiments.",
        "The choice of cybersecurity paradigms constrains conclusions by prioritizing cryptographic and detection-based solutions, potentially underemphasizing physical-layer or human-factor vulnerabilities."
      ],
      "Academic_Discourse_and_Rhetoric": [
        "The paper engages in disciplinary discourse by reviewing and critiquing prior work, positioning itself as a consolidating survey to bridge gaps between research and practical V2X deployment.",
        "Authors use specific terminology like PKI, misbehavior, and Sybil attacks; the tone is formal and authoritative, with rhetorical strategies including categorization tables and comparative analysis to clarify complex concepts.",
        "Authority is built through extensive citations of standards and 150+ papers, demonstrating breadth; motivations include establishing credibility in V2X security and advocating for standardized solutions."
      ],
      "Conclusions_and_Implications": [
        "Main conclusions are that V2X security requires layered defenses against threats like DoS and false data injection, existing solutions have semantic gaps (e.g., in revocation strategies), and infrastructure vulnerabilities need attention.",
        "Insights for future research include addressing RSU trust issues, improving detection algorithms for stealthy attackers, conducting real-world testing, and exploring integration with emerging technologies like LTE-V2X."
