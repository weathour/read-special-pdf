    "abstract": "The deployment and acceptance of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies are essential for the advancement of intelligent transportation systems, requiring robust simulation tools for development and validation. This paper offers an overview of leading V2X simulation tools, emphasizing their role in communication and cybersecurity applications. Existing surveys are reviewed, identifying gaps such as the limited coverage of less known tools such as CARLA and CarSim and the absence of detailed market analyses. A thorough assessment of the market significance of V2X simulation tools is provided, highlighting annual trends and profiling leading companies. Publication trends across major scientific databases are also examined, reflecting the growing interest and research diversity in V2X simulations. The review includes an analysis of crucial simulation tools such as SUMO, NS3, OMNeT++, Veins, and CARLA, emphasizing their contributions to V2X communications. Regarding cybersecurity, the study explores simulation parameters for mitigating security threats such as jamming, spoofing, Denial of Service (DoS), and eavesdropping. Furthermore, the increasing integration of different simulation tools is highlighted to address their individual limitations. Finally, emerging research opportunities are identified, advocating for the integration of co-simulation frameworks and AI-driven (Artificial Intelligence) approaches to improve the accuracy and resilience of V2X systems. This survey aims to guide future research efforts in developing secure, efficient, and scalable V2X communication technologies.",
