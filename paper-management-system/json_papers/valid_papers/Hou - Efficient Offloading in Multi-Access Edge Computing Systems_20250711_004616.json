    "abstract": "This thesis thoroughly explores Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and Vehicular Networking in 5G/6G environments, focusing on energy-efficient offloading and management. It addresses challenges in network resource management through three research areas: surveying MEC in vehicular networks, developing an SDN-assisted energy-efficient framework (SDN-MEC-EE), and proposing restless-bandit-based offloading policies (HEE-ACC) for task handover. The SDN-MEC-EE achieves 15-20% power reduction and lower latency, while HEE-ACC policies demonstrate scalability in large networks with theoretical near-optimality.",
    "methodology": "Combines comprehensive literature survey, SDN-assisted framework design with Docker container optimization, and restless-bandit-based resource allocation techniques with stochastic optimization for task offloading.",
    "conclusion": "The SDN-MEC-EE framework significantly improves energy efficiency and reduces latency in vehicular networks. HEE-ACC policies provide scalable near-optimal solutions for energy-efficient task offloading with handover in large-scale MEC systems.",
