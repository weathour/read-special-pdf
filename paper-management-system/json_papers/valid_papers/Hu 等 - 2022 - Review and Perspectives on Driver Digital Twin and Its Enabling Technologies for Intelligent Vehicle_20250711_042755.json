    "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) is introduced to digitize connected automated vehicles, but existing studies neglect driver digitization. This paper proposes Driver Digital Twin (DDT) to bridge automated systems and fully digitized driving human cyber-physical systems (H-CPS). DDT emphasizes multimodal state fusion, personalized modeling, and time variance for human-centric intelligent driving. Key enabling technologies are reviewed, applications discussed, and challenges outlined.",
    "methodology": "Comprehensive literature review of driver modeling technologies (distraction detection, attention estimation, intention prediction, drowsiness detection, emotion monitoring, trust assessment, behavior recognition). Analysis of DDT architecture (real driver, digital driver, multimodal interface, applications) and implementation paradigms.",
    "conclusion": "DDT provides a systematic framework for driver digitization, enabling harmonious human-centric driving systems. It enhances safety, personalization, and autonomous vehicle development but requires unified modeling, unsupervised data analysis, multimodal fusion, and regulatory solutions.",
