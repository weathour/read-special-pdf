    "abstract": "Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have emerged as a potential solution to the future challenges of developing safe, efficient, and eco-friendly transportation systems. However, CAV control presents significant challenges due to the complexity of interconnectivity and coordination required among vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which has shown notable advancements in addressing complex problems in autonomous driving, robotics, and human-vehicle interaction, emerges as a promising tool to enhance CAV capabilities. Despite its potential, there is a notable absence of current reviews on mainstream MARL algorithms for CAVs. To fill this gap, this paper offers a comprehensive review of MARL's application in CAV control. The paper begins with an introduction to MARL, explaining its unique advantages in handling complex and multi-agent scenarios. It then presents a detailed survey of MARL applications across various control dimensions for CAVs, including critical scenarios such as platooning control, lane-changing, and unsignalized intersections. Additionally, the paper reviews prominent simulation platforms essential for developing and testing MARL algorithms for CAVs. Lastly, it examines the current challenges in deploying MARL for CAV control, including safety, communication, mixed traffic, and sim-to-real challenges. Potential solutions discussed include hierarchical MARL, decentralized MARL, adaptive interactions, and offline MARL.",

    "conclusion": "MARL is a promising approach for CAV control but faces challenges in safety, communication, mixed traffic environments, and sim-to-real transfer. Future research should focus on robust inter-agent communication, safety-aware MARL frameworks, and bridging the sim-to-real gap to enable scalable and reliable deployment.",
