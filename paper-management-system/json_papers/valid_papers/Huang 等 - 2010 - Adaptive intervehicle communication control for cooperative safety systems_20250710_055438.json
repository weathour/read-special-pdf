    "abstract": "Vehicular ad hoc networks play a critical role in enabling important active safety applications such as cooperative collision warning. These active safety applications rely on continuous broadcast of self-information by all vehicles, which allows each vehicle to track all its neighboring cars in real time. The most pressing challenge in such safety-driven communication is to maintain acceptable tracking accuracy while avoiding congestion in the shared channel. In this article we propose a transmission control protocol that adapts communication rate and power based on the dynamics of a vehicular network and safety-driven tracking process. The proposed solution uses a closed-loop control concept and accounts for wireless channel unreliability. Simulation results confirm that if packet generation rate and associated transmission power for safety messages are adjusted in an on-demand and adaptive fashion, robust tracking is possible under various traffic conditions.",
    "methodology": "The research employs a joint rate-power control algorithm for adaptive transmission in vehicular networks. Rate control adjusts transmission probability based on suspected tracking error using a stochastic formula, while power control scales transmission range linearly with observed channel occupancy. Simulations are conducted using OPNET for network modeling and SHIFT for microscopic traffic simulation, with performance evaluated through tracking error metrics.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed adaptive rate-power control algorithm significantly reduces tracking error compared to fixed-interval beaconing methods (e.g., 100 ms or 500 ms intervals), ensuring robust performance across diverse traffic scenarios. It prioritizes nearby vehicles during congestion, enhancing safety while maintaining efficient channel usage.",
