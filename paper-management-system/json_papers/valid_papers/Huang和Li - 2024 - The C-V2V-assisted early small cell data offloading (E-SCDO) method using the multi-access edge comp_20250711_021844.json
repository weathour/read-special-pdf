    "abstract": "This work proposed the concept of Early Small Cell Data Offloading (E-SCDO) that allows a moving vehicle to launch small cell data offloading before the vehicle is inside the signal coverage of a small cell. The method uses Cellular Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V) sidelinks with helper vehicles inside small cell coverage and a Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC)-based SideLink Assisted (SLA) E-SCDO algorithm for vehicle pairing. Performance evaluations show superiority over traditional self-small cell offloading in network traffic performance.",
    "methodology": "Proposes a four-phase MEC-based SLA E-SCDO method: (1) Data Collecting phase for context reporting, (2) Matching phase using Auction algorithm for bipartite graph-based vehicle pairing, (3) Offloading phase with robustness tracking, and (4) Self-Small cell offloading phase. Utility function incorporates path lifetime and QoS (via bidirectional CAM received ratio).",
    "conclusion": "The SLA E-SCDO method significantly outperforms traditional offloading, especially in middle-high density scenarios, with higher throughput, increased offloading fraction (up to 40% early offloading), and reduced transmission time. Path switching enhances robustness against mobility disruptions.",
