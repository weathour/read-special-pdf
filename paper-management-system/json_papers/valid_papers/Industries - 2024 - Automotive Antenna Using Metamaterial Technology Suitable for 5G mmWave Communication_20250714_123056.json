    "abstract": "This paper reports on the development of an antenna suitable for 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, incorporating metamaterial technologies such as Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) and Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC). The goal is to achieve automated driving by utilizing 5G, which offers high-speed, large-capacity, and low-latency features. To enable efficient data communication, particularly for sensing information, the use of mmWave band with a bandwidth of several hundred MHz is required. However, the use of an array antenna consisting of multiple patch antenna elements on the roof of a vehicle poses challenges in terms of radiation characteristics. This study aims to address these challenges through the development of an antenna suitable for 5G mmWave communication.",
    "methodology": "The study employs metamaterial technologies, specifically Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) and Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC), to address challenges in radiation characteristics of array antennas on vehicle roofs. Simulation and prototype evaluation are used to validate the designs.",
    "conclusion": "The developed antenna, incorporating EBG and AMC, successfully mitigates irregular directivity in the horizontal plane caused by surface wave modes and prevents nulls in vertical plane directivity due to roof reflections. This technology supports the advancement of automated driving by enabling efficient 5G mmWave communication.",
