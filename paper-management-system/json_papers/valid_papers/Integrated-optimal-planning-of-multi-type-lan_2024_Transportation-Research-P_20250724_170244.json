    "abstract": "In a prolonged transitional period, the urban transportation infrastructure is expected to accommodate two different types of vehicles. One type of vehicle is the human-driven vehicle (HV) and the other is the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV). Nevertheless, the conflict between HVs and CAVs in the mixed traffic scenario significantly impedes the efficiency-improvement benefit of implementing emerging CAV technologies. To harness the full potential of CAVs in enhancing traffic efficiency and network performance, multi-type lanes (i.e., regular lanes, dedicated CAV lanes, and CAV toll lanes) and multi-type intersections (i.e., conventional signalized intersections, novel signalized intersections with an exclusive phase and exclusive approaches, and smart signal-free intersections) are proposed to efficiently manage the heterogeneous traffic flow on roads and at intersections, respectively.",
    "methodology": "The integrated planning problem of multi-type lanes and intersections (IPPLI) in the mixed transportation network is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model based on the link-node modeling method. It is solved by an improved evolutionary algorithm-based approach, which consists of two modules cooperating with each other.",
    "conclusion": "Experimental results show that the proposed model consistently performs outstandingly across a range of CAV penetration rates. Our model achieves maximum improvements of 25.71% and 4.84% in reducing travel costs compared to models that only plan multi-type lanes and multi-type intersections, respectively. Additionally, the improved evolutionary algorithm-based approach reduces the convergence time by 20.51% and 26.81% compared to the classical evolutionary algorithm and the genetic algorithm provided by MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox.",
