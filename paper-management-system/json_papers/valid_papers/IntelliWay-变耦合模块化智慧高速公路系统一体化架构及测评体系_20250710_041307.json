    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the development of smart highway systems, presents typical vehicle-road collaboration logical and physical models, and proposes a new-generation hierarchical modular architecture for smart highway systems. The architecture includes intelligent grading based on variable coupling levels and event-driven data distribution mechanisms. It reviews emerging technologies driving smart highway development, such as vehicle high-precision positioning, ADAS, vehicle bus systems, roadside equipment optimization, heterogeneous network integration, network load balancing, cybersecurity, multi-sensor fusion, user-centric adaptive information release, vehicle group collaborative autonomous driving, big data and AI-based traffic prediction, lane-level active traffic management, and component-based service development. Implementation suggestions are provided based on these technologies. The paper analyzes typical application scenarios like broadcast traffic information services, active traffic management, accompanying information services, autonomous driving dedicated lanes, and vehicle platoon collaborative driving. It evaluates testing methods and case studies for smart highway systems, systematically analyzes challenges and future trends, and highlights the role of high-trust information interaction and intelligent collaborative control among humans, goods, vehicles, roads, and clouds in providing reliable real-time traffic environments for autonomous driving.",
    "methodology": "The research employs a hierarchical modular architecture design with variable coupling degrees, event-driven data distribution mechanisms, and case study analysis. Key methods include system architecture modeling, technology review, simulation-based evaluation, and real-world case studies. Data sources involve international smart highway systems (e.g., US, Europe, Japan), and the Chang'an University-led national project data. Experimental design includes virtual reality simulations, hardware-in-loop testing, and field validations using representative scenarios like congestion management and autonomous driving corridors.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed variable coupling modular architecture enhances smart highway system efficiency, safety, and scalability. Key conclusions include the effectiveness of hierarchical intelligent grading in standardizing deployments, the critical role of edge-cloud collaboration in real-time decision-making, and the importance of event-driven data distribution for adaptive traffic management. Case studies, such as the Hang-Shao-Yong Smart Highway, demonstrate improved average vehicle speeds by 10%-20%. Challenges like high implementation costs and cybersecurity risks are identified, with future trends pointing towards enhanced AI integration and human-vehicle-road-cloud synergy for autonomous driving environments.",
