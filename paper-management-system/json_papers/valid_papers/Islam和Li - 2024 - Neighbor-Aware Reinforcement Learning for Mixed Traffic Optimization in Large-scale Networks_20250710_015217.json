    "abstract": "Managing mixed traffic comprising human-driven and robot vehicles (RVs) across large-scale networks presents unique challenges beyond single-intersection control. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for coordinating mixed traffic across multiple interconnected intersections. Our key contribution is a neighbor-aware reward mechanism that enables RVs to maintain balanced distribution across the network while optimizing local intersection efficiency. We evaluate our approach using a real-world network, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing realistic traffic patterns. Results show that our method reduces average waiting times by 39.2% compared to the state-of-the-art single-intersection control policy and 79.8% compared to traditional traffic signals. The framework's ability to coordinate traffic across multiple intersections while maintaining balanced RV distribution provides a foundation for deploying learning-based solutions in urban traffic systems.",
    "methodology": "Reinforcement learning framework using the Rainbow DQN algorithm with a novel neighbor-aware reward mechanism, incorporating local efficiency, conflict avoidance, and neighbor distribution components. State representation includes local intersection conditions (e.g., queue length, waiting time, occupancy) and downstream network state. Evaluated on a real-world 17-intersection network in Colorado Springs with simulated traffic patterns.",
    "conclusion": "The framework significantly reduces average waiting times by 39.2% compared to single-intersection RL methods and 79.8% compared to traditional signals, demonstrating effective coordination of mixed traffic in large-scale networks while maintaining balanced RV distribution. It provides a foundation for deploying learning-based solutions in urban traffic systems.",

      "Overview": "This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing mixed traffic (human-driven and robot vehicles) in large-scale urban networks, focusing on neighbor-aware rewards to balance vehicle distribution and improve coordination across multiple intersections.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Urban traffic congestion causes significant economic losses and reduced quality of life, with drivers losing up to 101 hours annually and economic losses exceeding $9 billion yearly due to wasted time.",
        "The research aims to address challenges in scaling mixed traffic control to large networks, such as maintaining balanced robot vehicle (RV) distribution, managing downstream impacts of intersection decisions, and adapting to dynamic traffic conditions, which are not handled by existing single-intersection or full-autonomy approaches.",
        "The authors argue that existing methods fail to address large-scale coordination in mixed traffic scenarios, creating a necessity for scalable solutions to reduce congestion and improve efficiency, as urban networks are critical bottlenecks.",
        "The specific problem of network-wide mixed traffic control is linked to broader challenges in intelligent transportation systems, establishing significance through potential reductions in waiting times and emissions, as demonstrated by intersection-level studies.",
        "This paper contributes to the disciplines of Reinforcement Learning, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and Autonomous Vehicle Control."

          "Network-aware state representation: A state space that includes local intersection conditions (e.g., queue length, waiting time, occupancy) and downstream intersection states to inform RV decisions."
        ],
        "The logical relationship network: The neighbor-aware reward guides RV actions (Stop/Go) based on the network-aware state, with R_neighbor promoting balanced RV distribution to prevent bottlenecks, while R_local and R_conflict optimize immediate intersection efficiency and safety.",
        "Key assumptions include a fixed RV penetration rate of 60%, the use of simulation for evaluation, and the exclusion of secondary roads in the network model to focus on major intersections.",
        "The paper makes a methodological contribution by introducing a novel reward mechanism for scalable reinforcement learning in traffic control, advancing knowledge in network-wide mixed traffic optimization."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include the Rainbow DQN algorithm with a three-layer neural network (512 units per layer), a state representation capturing local and downstream conditions, and a reward function defined as R(s, a) = R_local(s, a) + R_conflict(s, a) + αR_neighbor(s, a).",
        "The methodology is novel for its neighbor-aware reward that addresses network-wide coordination, applicable to real-world urban networks; its rationality is supported by balancing local efficiency with global distribution.",
        "Data sources include a real-world network from Colorado Springs with 17 intersections, using traffic demand modeled from Google Maps patterns; preprocessing involved extracting major roads and setting control zones of 30 meters. Representativeness is evaluated as high due to realistic urban conditions and peak-hour patterns.",
        "Experimental design is rigorous with three independent runs (1,500 seconds each, last 1,000 seconds for metrics), comparing against baselines (HV-Signalized, HV-Unsignalized, Local-RL); evaluation metrics like average waiting time are adequate for capturing efficiency.",
        "The research follows the reinforcement learning theoretical paradigm, specifically deep Q-learning, which affects the perspective by emphasizing data-driven policy optimization over traditional control methods."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Key experimental results show an average waiting time of 2.14 seconds with the proposed method, compared to 3.52 seconds for Local-RL (single-intersection baseline) and 10.60 seconds for HV-Signalized, representing reductions of 39.2% and 79.8%, respectively.",
        "Results are significant for demonstrating scalable traffic efficiency improvements, reliable due to multiple evaluation runs, and stable as the framework maintains balanced RV distribution across intersections."
      ],
      "Argumentation_and_Logic": [
        "The overall argument structure progresses from problem identification (traffic congestion challenges) to literature review (limitations of existing methods), method proposal (neighbor-aware RL), experimental validation, and conclusion.",
        "Key steps include: (1) Establishing the gap in large-scale mixed traffic control, (2) Introducing the novel reward and state representation, (3) Validating with real-world simulations, and (4) Demonstrating performance gains. Logical links connect RV distribution to network efficiency.",
        "Strengths include clear logical progression from problem to solution; weaknesses include limited discussion of potential rebuttals, such as generalization to varying RV penetration rates. The authors address scalability by showing results on a 17-intersection network."
      ],
      "Strengths_and_Limitations": [
        "Strengths include the novel neighbor-aware reward mechanism, significant waiting time reductions, and scalability to large networks demonstrated through real-world simulations.",
        "Limitations include the assumption of a fixed 60% RV penetration rate, reliance on simulation without real-world testing, and exclusion of secondary roads in the network model.",
        "The choice of reinforcement learning constrains conclusions to data-driven optimization, potentially overlooking human behavior complexities or unforeseen traffic disruptions."
      ],
      "Academic_Discourse_and_Rhetoric": [
        "The paper positions itself within the discourse by advancing reinforcement learning for traffic control, filling gaps in large-scale mixed traffic coordination while building on intersection-level studies.",
        "Authors use specific terminology like 'robot vehicles (RVs)' and 'mixed traffic', a technical tone, and rhetorical strategies such as emphasizing 'network-wide' benefits to highlight innovation.",
        "Authority is built through citations of foundational works (e.g., Dresner and Stone for intersection management, Wang et al. for RL-based control), with motivations to establish credibility and differentiate from prior approaches."
      ],
