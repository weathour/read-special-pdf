    "abstract": "Managing mixed traffic comprising human-driven and robot vehicles (RVs) across large-scale networks presents unique challenges beyond single-intersection control. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for coordinating mixed traffic across multiple interconnected intersections. Our key contribution is a neighbor-aware reward mechanism that enables RVs to maintain balanced distribution across the network while optimizing local intersection efficiency. We evaluate our approach using a real-world network, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing realistic traffic patterns. Results show that our method reduces average waiting times by 39.2% compared to the state-of-the-art single-intersection control policy and 79.8% compared to traditional traffic signals. The framework's ability to coordinate traffic across multiple intersections while maintaining balanced RV distribution provides a foundation for deploying learning-based solutions in urban traffic systems.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework using a Rainbow DQN algorithm with a novel neighbor-aware reward mechanism. The framework includes a network-aware state representation and a reward function that balances local efficiency with network-wide RV distribution.",
    "conclusion": "The study presents a scalable RL-based framework for managing traffic in large-scale urban networks, demonstrating significant reductions in average waiting times compared to traditional methods and single-intersection RL approaches. Future work includes integration with existing techniques, large-scale traffic simulation, and hardware testing.",
