    "abstract": "Dramatic increase in road traffic volume has made driving safety and traffic efficiency more challenging, but smart transportation has been spotlighted as a promising technology for improving driving safety and efficiency. This paper surveys safe and efficient driving in the smart transportation with a focus on the aspects of systems, protocols, applications, and security, especially for autonomous vehicles. This smart transportation requires to monitor road surfaces precisely and identify hazards, and vehicles also need to share sensing information to avoid dangerous situations or environments through wireless communication in vehicular networks. For this purpose, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) have achieved the international standards of the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), and applications are now common that use the global positioning systems (GPS) for a dedicated navigation system navigator or smartphone application. This combination of vehicular networking and navigation enables systems and applications not only to enhance driving safety, but also to increase traffic efficiency. To support the vehicular systems and applications efficiently, the protocols need to be designed carefully and implemented effectively. This paper summarizes and analyzes the state-of-the-art research based on standardization activities for smart transportation systems, protocols, applications, and security. This paper also provides the comparison between the different technologies composing vehicular systems, protocols, applications, and security in terms of advantages, disadvantages, analysis, simulation, implementation, and complexity to provide a trend of overall technologies. Lastly, this paper suggests research directions for the smart transportation.",
