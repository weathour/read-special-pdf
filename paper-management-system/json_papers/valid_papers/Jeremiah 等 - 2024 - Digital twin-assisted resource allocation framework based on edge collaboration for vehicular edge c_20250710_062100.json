    "abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) supports latency-sensitive and computation-intensive vehicular applications by providing caching and computing services in vehicle proximity. This reduces congestion and transmission latency. However, VEC faces implementation challenges due to high vehicle mobility and unpredictable network dynamics. The proposed framework integrates Digital Twin (DT) technology to create virtual replicas of network nodes, enabling edge collaboration and real-time resource information. Channel state information (CSI) is used for RSU selection with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication. The optimization problem maximizes computation rate and minimizes task delay through joint offloading decisions, subchannel allocation, and RSU association. This NP-hard problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved via Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm. Simulations demonstrate superiority over benchmarks in reducing task completion delay and improving computation rates.",
