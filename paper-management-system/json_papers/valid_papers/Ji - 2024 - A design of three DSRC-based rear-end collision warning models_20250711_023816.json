    "abstract": "Road traffic crashes result in a significant number of fatalities and economic losses worldwide. Rear-end collisions, caused by insufficient distance between vehicles, are a major contributor to these accidents. To address this issue, the use of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) technology has been developed prominence in last decade. However, uncertainties associated with DSRC-based systems, such as GPS positioning errors and transmission delays, pose challenges to the development of robust collision warning models. In this paper, a design of three DSRC-based rear-end collision warning models to mitigate the impact of uncertainties. The models include the vehicle kinetic model (VK), the maximum compensation vehicle kinetic model (MC VK), and the artificial neural network model (NN). The VK model shows both a high possibility of false warning and missing. The MC VK model shows a 0 possibility in missing warning, which can be determined as the early warning boundary. The NN model shows low probability in both false and missing warning, and 80 correct warning makes it a good candidate for emergency warning boundary.",
    "methodology": "Proposes three models: Vehicle Kinetic Model (VK) based on vehicle dynamics, Maximum Compensation Vehicle Kinetic Model (MC VK) that compensates for uncertainties, and Artificial Neural Network Model (NN) using a backpropagation neural network. Simulations are conducted in MATLAB and OPNET under 15 scenarios with varying speeds (from TABLE 1), each run 100 times. Assumptions include vehicles traveling in the same lane, subject vehicle (SV) faster than lead vehicle (LV), no GPS failure or DSRC disconnection, and use of economical GPS receivers. Uncertainties like GPS positioning errors (modeled as Gaussian) and transmission delays are incorporated.",
    "conclusion": "The Neural Network (NN) model demonstrates superior performance for emergency warnings with low probabilities of false and missing warnings and over 80% correct warnings. The Maximum Compensation Vehicle Kinetic (MC VK) model shows zero missing warnings, making it ideal for early warning boundaries. This research provides a foundation for future development of reliable rear-end collision warning systems.",
