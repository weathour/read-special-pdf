    "abstract": "As basic research, it has also received increasing attention from people that the 'curse of dimensionality' will lead to increase the cost of data storage and computing; it also influences the efficiency and accuracy of dealing with problems. Feature dimensionality reduction as a key link in the process of pattern recognition has become one hot and difficulty spot in the field of pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. It is one of the most challenging research fields, which has been favored by most of the scholars' attention. How to implement 'low loss' in the process of feature dimension reduction, keep the nature of the original data, find out the best mapping and get the optimal low dimensional data are the keys aims of the research. In this paper, two-dimensionality reduction methods, feature selection and feature extraction, are introduced; the current mainstream dimensionality reduction algorithms are analyzed, including the method for small sample and method based on deep learning. For each algorithm, examples of their application are given and the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are evaluated.",
    "methodology": "Review and analysis of dimensionality reduction algorithms, including feature selection (e.g., filter, wrapper methods) and feature extraction (linear methods like PCA, LDA; nonlinear methods like kernel PCA, manifold learning). Evaluation based on application examples and algorithmic trade-offs.",
    "conclusion": "Dimensionality reduction is essential for mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Feature selection and extraction methods each have strengths: selection retains interpretability, while extraction efficiently compresses features. Challenges include preserving data integrity and optimizing mappings. Future work should focus on scalable, adaptable algorithms for emerging data complexities.",

It covers linear/nonlinear approaches, small-sample adaptations, and applications across pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "High-dimensional data increases storage/computational costs and reduces analytical accuracy due to the curse of dimensionality, where redundant features obscure essential information.",

        "Core concepts: (1) Feature Selection: Selecting relevant feature subsets (e.g., via filters/wrappers). (2) Feature Extraction: Transforming features into lower dimensions (e.g., PCA, manifold learning). (3) Curse of Dimensionality: Performance degradation as feature count increases.",
        "Selection identifies critical features; extraction creates new representations. Both aim to minimize information loss while reducing computational burden.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include filter/wrapper/heuristic searches for selection; PCA/LDA (linear) and kernel/ICA/manifold learning (nonlinear) for extraction. Small-sample techniques (e.g., PLS, Lasso) are detailed.",
        "Novelty lies in categorizing methods by sample size and linearity. Applicability is evaluated via real-world examples (e.g., DNA microarrays); rationality via algorithmic strengths/weaknesses.",
        "Data sources: Gene expression, image, and sensor datasets. Preprocessing includes normalization; representativeness is inferred from cited applications but not empirically validated.",
        "Analytical evaluation based on theoretical rigor and case studies; lacks controlled experiments. Metrics include computational efficiency, preservation of discriminative power.",
        "Rooted in statistical learning and linear algebra; this paradigm emphasizes mathematical optimization over heuristic approaches."

      "Results": [
        "Key outcomes: Feature selection excels in interpretability but struggles with high correlations; extraction methods like PCA are efficient but linear. Nonlinear techniques (e.g., ISOMAP) handle complex structures but are computationally intensive.",
        "Results are significant for guiding method selection; reliability is derived from literature consensus. Stability varies—linear methods are robust; nonlinear/manifold learning sensitive to parameters."
