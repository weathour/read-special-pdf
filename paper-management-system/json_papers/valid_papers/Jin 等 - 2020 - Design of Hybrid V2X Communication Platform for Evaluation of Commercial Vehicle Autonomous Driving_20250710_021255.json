    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a design method and process for hybrid V2X communication platform that combines WAVE communication and LTE-V2X communication which are C-ITS communication protocols for vehicle environments and Legacy LTE communication which is a commercial mobile communication for evaluating the autonomous platooning platform of commercial vehicles. For a safe and efficient autonomous platooning platform, an low-latency communication function based on C-ITS communication is required, and to control it, commercial communication functions such as Legacy LTE, which can be connected at all times, are required. In order to evaluate such a system, the evaluation equipment must have the same level of communication performance or higher. The main design contents presented in this paper will be applied to the implementation of hybrid V2X terminals for functional evaluation.",

    "conclusion": "The designed hybrid V2X communication platform meets evaluation requirements for commercial vehicle platooning systems. Functional verification was completed, and the platform will be deployed in Saemangeum autonomous driving testbed for performance analysis.",
