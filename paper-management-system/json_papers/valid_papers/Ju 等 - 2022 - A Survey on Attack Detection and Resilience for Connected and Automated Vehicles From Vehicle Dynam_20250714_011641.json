    "abstract": "Recent advances in attack anomaly detection and resilience strategies for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are reviewed from vehicle dynamics and control perspective. Compared to traditional vehicles, CAVs are featured in the increasing number of perception sensors, advanced intra-vehicle communication technologies, capabilities of driving automation and connectivity between single vehicles. These features bring about safety issues which are not encountered in traditional vehicle systems. One main type of these issues is the attack or anomaly launched onto the perception sensors and the communication channels. With such a consideration, this survey summarizes and reviews the existing results on attack anomaly detection and resilience of CAVs in control frameworks. This paper reviews the results according to the positions at which the attacks anomalies occur. These positions are divided into three categories, namely, intra-vehicle communication network, perception sensors and inter-vehicle communication network. From this perspective, the recent attack anomaly detection and resilience results are reviewed according to different positions attacked. After reviewing existing results, some potential research directions and challenges are identiﬁed.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and systematic categorization of attack detection and resilience approaches based on attack positions (intra-vehicle networks, sensors, inter-vehicle networks). Analysis includes vehicle dynamic modeling, attack impact assessment, and evaluation of control-based countermeasures.",
    "conclusion": "Control-based approaches are essential for CAV security due to cyber-physical interactions. The survey identifies gaps in handling complex nonlinear dynamics, real-time detection requirements, and integration with path planning. Future research should address unknown inputs, extend methods to planar platoons, and develop strategies for multi-vehicle communication topologies.",

        "CAVs' increased sensors and connectivity introduce vulnerabilities not present in traditional vehicles, leading to safety risks like hijacking and collisions.",

        "Novelty: Position-based categorization (vs. attack-type focus); applicability to CAV-specific dynamics; rationality validated through case studies (e.g., platooning, lane keeping).",
        "Data: Synthesizes existing literature; representativeness ensured by covering major control journals/conferences. No primary data collection or preprocessing.",
        "Evaluation: Analyzes rigor via theoretical guarantees (e.g., stability proofs) and compares method limitations (e.g., noise sensitivity, computational burden).",
        "Follows control-theoretical paradigms (e.g., robust control, estimation theory), focusing on model-based approaches over data-driven techniques."
