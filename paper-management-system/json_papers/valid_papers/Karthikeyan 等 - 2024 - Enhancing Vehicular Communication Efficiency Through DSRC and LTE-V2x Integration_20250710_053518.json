    "abstract": "With the remarkable development of vehicles on the road, the demand for efficient vehicular communication has surged. This has led to the rise of Vehicle-Based Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), which offer innovative solutions to enhance street safety and traffic management. One prominent technology, Dedicated Short-Reach Communication (DSRC), operates within the dedicated 5.9 GHz band and is tailored for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. While DSRC provides reliable performance, its data rates and communication range remain limited. To address these limitations, this project proposes integrating DSRC with Long-Term Evolution Vehicle-to-Everything (LTE-V2X) technology. By combining DSRC's consistency with LTE-V2X's cellular-based framework, the integration aims to deliver higher data rates, extended communication reach, and flexibility in spectrum use, thus fostering more efficient vehicular communication.",
    "methodology": "Proposes integration of DSRC and LTE-V2X technologies with dynamic mode switching based on environmental factors and network availability. Leverages DSRC's reliability for short-range V2V/V2I communication and LTE-V2X's cellular infrastructure for extended coverage. Methodology includes literature review of comparable technologies and parameter analysis.",
    "conclusion": "The integration of DSRC and LTE-V2X addresses vehicular communication limitations by extending data rates, communication range, and spectrum flexibility. This synergistic approach enhances road safety, traffic management efficiency, and lays the foundation for smarter transportation systems. Future research should address security concerns in 5G VANETs.",
