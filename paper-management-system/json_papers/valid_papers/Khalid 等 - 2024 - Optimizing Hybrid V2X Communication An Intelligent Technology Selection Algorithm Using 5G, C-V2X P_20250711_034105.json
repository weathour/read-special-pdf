    "abstract": "Cooperative communications advancements in Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) are bolstering the autonomous driving paradigm. Conventional vehicular networks employ static wireless vehicular communication technology without considering traffic load or dynamics, leading to inefficiency. This study investigates hybrid V2X communication and proposes an autonomous and intelligent technology selection algorithm using a decision tree. The algorithm uses statistics from received Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs)—inter-vehicular distance, one-way end-to-end latency, and CAM density—to select the optimal technology (DSRC, C-V2X PC5, or 5G) for subsequent transmissions. Experimental validation demonstrates enhancements in latency, reliability, and packet delivery rate compared to static technology usage.",
