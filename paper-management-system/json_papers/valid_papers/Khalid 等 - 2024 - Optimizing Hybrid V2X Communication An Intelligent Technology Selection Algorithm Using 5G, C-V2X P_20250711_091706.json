    "abstract": "Cooperative communications advancements in Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) are bolstering the autonomous driving paradigm. Conventional vehicular networks employ static wireless communication technology without considering traffic load or dynamics, leading to inefficiency. This study investigates hybrid V2X communication and proposes an autonomous intelligent technology selection algorithm using a decision tree. The algorithm uses statistics from received Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs)—inter-vehicular distance, one-way end-to-end latency, and CAM density—to select the optimal technology (DSRC, C-V2X PC5, or 5G) for subsequent transmissions. Experimental validation demonstrates improvements in latency, reliability, and packet delivery rate compared to static technology approaches.",
    "methodology": "Decision tree-based algorithm utilizing real-time statistics from CAMs (latency, inter-vehicular distance, CAM density, message type, and node speed). Implemented and tested on a physical V2X testbed integrating DSRC, C-V2X PC5, and 5G Uu technologies. KPIs measured include latency, packet delivery rate (PDR), and reliability.",
    "conclusion": "The intelligent hybrid algorithm significantly enhances one-way end-to-end latency, reliability, and packet delivery rate compared to static technology usage. It dynamically adapts to traffic conditions, optimizes resource usage, and supports safety-critical applications through decentralized real-time decision-making.",
