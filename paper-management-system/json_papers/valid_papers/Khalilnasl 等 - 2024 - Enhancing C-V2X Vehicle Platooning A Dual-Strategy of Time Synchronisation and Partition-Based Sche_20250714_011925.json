    "abstract": "There is clear evidence indicating that the standardized Sensing-Based Semi-Persistent Scheduling scheme in Out-of-coverage possesses specific vulnerabilities. This unsatisfactory performance lies in the absence of coordination in channel scheduling and transmission time. Specifically, the determination to re-assign a resource after the reservation period expires is currently based on a random selection process, without consideration of the actual interference encountered by the utilized resources. In this study, a novel scheme is proposed to markedly improve the random selection method for vehicle positioning.",
    "methodology": "Proposes a dual-strategy approach: time synchronization using beacon signals for coordinated message generation and partition-based scheduling where resources are sorted and assigned to platoon members via random subset selection. Implemented through simulations using OMNeT++, SUMO, PLEXE, Veins, SimuLTE, and OpenCV2X with parameters like platoon size and background traffic.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed dual-strategy method reduces update delay and improves message success rates by minimizing Half-Duplex and Interference errors, enhancing reliability for vehicle platooning. It shows promise for LTE-V2X Mode 4 and potential applicability to NR-V2X Mode 2, supporting safer and more efficient autonomous mobility.",

      "Overview": "The paper enhances Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication for vehicle platooning by introducing a dual-strategy method to improve resource scheduling in out-of-coverage scenarios, addressing vulnerabilities in the standard Sensing-Based Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SB-SPS) algorithm.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Research background involves challenges in C-V2X direct communication (e.g., LTE-V2X Mode 4 and NR-V2X Mode 2) for vehicle platooning, where unreliable resource allocation in Out-of-Coverage (OoC) modes leads to data loss and safety risks.",
        "Motivation stems from the need to mitigate collisions and delays caused by the random resource selection in SB-SPS, which lacks coordination and ignores interference, hindering platoon efficiency and safety.",
        "Authors argue for necessity by highlighting that message transmission losses can cause temporary awareness lapses among platoon members, posing safety hazards, and emphasize the urgency for standardized improvements to support autonomous mobility.",
        "The specific problem of SB-SPS inefficiency is linked to broader challenges in vehicular communications, such as ensuring reliable, low-latency V2V interactions in dynamic environments, establishing its significance for intelligent transportation systems.",
        "Contributions span wireless communications, intelligent transportation systems, and networking disciplines, with interdisciplinary relevance to autonomous vehicles and smart mobility."
      ],
      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: (1) 'Time Synchronization'—aligning vehicle communication cycles via beacon signals (e.g., using GPS) to unify selection windows; (2) 'Partition-Based Scheduling'—dividing sorted resources into subsets for platoon members to minimize selection conflicts.",
        "Logical relationships: Synchronization enables simultaneous resource selection windows, facilitating partition-based scheduling, which then reduces collisions by ensuring distinct resource assignments, creating a coordinated framework for reliable communication.",
        "Key assumptions: Beacon signals provide accurate time synchronization; vehicles in a platoon can be identified and grouped; resources can be partitioned without significant overhead; and interference models in simulations reflect real-world conditions.",
        "The paper makes a methodological contribution by innovating the SB-SPS algorithm, enhancing the knowledge system in vehicular networking through a novel, simulation-validated approach to resource allocation."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include the dual-strategy of time synchronization (using beacon intervals) and partition-based MAC scheduling, implemented in network simulations via OMNeT++, SUMO, PLEXE, and OpenCV2X with modified MAC layers.",
        "Methodology novelty lies in replacing random selection with partitioned resource assignment; applicability is demonstrated for C-V2X platooning; rationality is supported by reduced collision probability in theoretical analysis and simulations.",
        "Data sources are simulated using parameters like platoon size (4-19 vehicles), background traffic (20-300 vehicles), and communication settings (e.g., 100 ms beacon intervals). Data representativeness is evaluated as realistic for highway scenarios but limited to simulation environments without real-world noise.",
        "Experimental design is rigorous with 20 repetitions per scenario, metrics like success rate and update delay, and comparisons against SB-SPS; evaluation metrics are adequate for assessing reliability but may not cover all edge cases.",
        "The research follows 3GPP standards paradigm for vehicular communications, which shapes the focus on OoC modes and resource allocation, providing a structured framework but potentially constraining innovations beyond current specifications."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Key results: The proposed method reduces update delay (e.g., from above 500 ms in SB-SPS to lower values), increases message success rates (e.g., by approximately 1% for small platoons), and shows better distinct resource selection in heatmaps.",
        "Results are significant for improving platoon safety and efficiency; reliability is supported by repeated simulations showing consistent trends; stability is demonstrated across varying platoon sizes and background traffic, though effectiveness decreases with larger platoons."

      "Argumentation_and_Logic": [
        "Overall argument structure: Introduces SB-SPS vulnerabilities, proposes dual-strategy solution, details methodology, presents simulation results, and concludes with enhancements.",
        "Key steps: Problem identification in SB-SPS → Proposal of synchronization and partitioning → Simulation implementation → Performance comparison → Validation of improvements.",
        "Strengths include clear, incremental logic from problem to solution; weaknesses involve reliance on ideal synchronization assumptions. Authors address rebuttals by showing reduced collision probability in partitioned selection and benchmarking against standards."
