    "abstract": "The quality of service (QoS) in public transportation is not at an acceptable level in high-mobility scenarios as penetration loss severely degrades signal quality and reduces the achievable data rate. Also, high mobility requirement is included in 5G as an essential part of its design. In this paper, a background of mobility management in high-speed scenarios and a review of underlay mobility management are presented. After a discussion of the usual high mobility challenges, major techniques for dealing with mobility management are reviewed, including architectural support, handover optimization, and employing new techniques like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and energy efficiency maximization. Also, challenges and prospective research directions for each technique are provided. The primary objective of this research study is to enhance knowledge of mobility management in high-speed vehicular scenarios, specifically by employing network architectural support in an upcoming heterogeneous mobile network.",
    "methodology": "This paper conducts a comprehensive review and comparative analysis of mobility management techniques, focusing on architectural supports (e.g., moving relays, cloud radio access networks), handover optimization strategies, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and energy efficiency maximization. It synthesizes findings from existing literature, simulations, and technical reports without original experimental data.",
    "conclusion": "The paper concludes that mobility management in high-speed vehicular scenarios faces significant challenges such as frequent handover failures, low QoS due to vehicle penetration loss, and high energy consumption. It emphasizes the need for advanced architectures like moving relays and techniques such as NOMA to enhance performance, and identifies future research directions including predictive handover, AI integration, and energy-efficient protocols for 5G and beyond networks.",

      "Overview": "This paper reviews mobility management challenges and solutions in heterogeneous vehicular networks for 5G, focusing on high-speed scenarios like railways and highways. It surveys techniques to address issues such as signal degradation and handover failures, categorizing approaches into architectural supports, handover optimization, NOMA, and energy efficiency.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The research addresses challenges in wireless communications for high-mobility environments (e.g., high-speed railways, vehicular networks) where existing systems like GSM-R and LTE-A fail to provide adequate QoS due to vehicle penetration loss and frequent handovers.",
        "Motivation stems from 5G's inclusion of high mobility as a core requirement, necessitating new methods to ensure reliable broadband services at speeds up to 500 km/h, which current technologies cannot support effectively.",
        "Authors argue for urgency by highlighting performance degradation in high-speed scenarios, increased demand for vehicular applications, and the critical role of mobility management in enabling future transportation systems.",
        "The specific problem of mobility management is linked to broader challenges in 5G deployment, such as network densification and interference, establishing significance through references to standards (e.g., IMT-2020) and real-world limitations.",
