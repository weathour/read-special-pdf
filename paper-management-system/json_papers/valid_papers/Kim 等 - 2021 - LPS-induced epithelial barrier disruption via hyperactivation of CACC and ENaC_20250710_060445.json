    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases the susceptibility of cells to pathogenic diseases, including inflammatory diseases and septic syndrome. In our experiments, we examined whether LPS induces epithelial barrier disruption in secretory epithelia and further investigated its underlying mechanism. The activities of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CACC) and epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) were monitored with a short-circuit current using an Ussing chamber. Epithelial membrane integrity was estimated via transepithelial electrical resistance and paracellular permeability assays. We found that the apical application of LPS evoked short-circuit current (Isc) through the activation of CACC and ENaC. Although LPS disrupted epithelial barrier integrity, this was restored with the inhibition of CACC and ENaC, indicating the role of CACC and ENaC in the regulation of paracellular pathways. We confirmed that LPS, CACC, or ENaC activation evoked apical membrane depolarization. The exposure to a high-K+ buffer increased paracellular permeability. LPS induced the rapid redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and reduced the expression levels of ZO-1 in tight junctions through apical membrane depolarization and tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the LPS-induced epithelial barrier disruption and degradation of ZO-1 were largely recovered by blocking CACC and ENaC. Furthermore, although LPS-impaired epithelial barrier became vulnerable to secondary bacterial infections, this vulnerability was prevented by inhibiting CACC and ENaC. We concluded that LPS induces the disruption of epithelial barrier integrity through the activation of CACC and ENaC, resulting in apical membrane depolarization and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1.",

      "Overview": "This paper investigates how lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria disrupts epithelial barrier integrity in secretory epithelia. It identifies hyperactivation of calcium-activated chloride channels (CACC) and epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) as central mechanisms, linking ion channel activity to tight junction disassembly via apical membrane depolarization and tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1.",
