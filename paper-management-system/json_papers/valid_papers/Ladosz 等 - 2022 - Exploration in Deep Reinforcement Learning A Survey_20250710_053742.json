    "abstract": "This paper reviews exploration techniques in deep reinforcement learning. Exploration techniques are of primary importance when solving sparse reward problems. In sparse reward problems, the reward is rare, which means that the agent will not find the reward often by acting randomly. In such a scenario, it is challenging for reinforcement learning to learn rewards and actions association. Thus more sophisticated exploration methods need to be devised. This review provides a comprehensive overview of existing exploration approaches, which are categorized based on the key contributions as follows: reward novel states, reward diverse behaviours, goal-based methods, probabilistic methods, imitation-based methods, safe exploration and random-based methods. Then, the unsolved challenges are discussed to provide valuable future research directions. Finally, the approaches of different categories are compared in terms of complexity, computational effort and overall performance.",

The survey categorizes approaches into seven groups, identifies unsolved challenges (e.g., noisy-TV problem, scalability limitations), and provides future research directions.

      "Overview": "This survey paper comprehensively reviews exploration techniques in deep reinforcement learning, focusing on methods to address sparse reward problems. It categorizes approaches into seven groups, compares their performance on standard benchmarks, and discusses unresolved challenges.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Sparse reward problems in real-world scenarios (e.g., search and rescue, delivery) where rewards are infrequent and delayed, making action-reward associations difficult to learn.",
        "Limitations of naive solutions like random exploration (e.g., ε-greedy) and reward shaping, which are inefficient or designer-dependent, necessitate advanced exploration algorithms.",
        "The authors emphasize the prevalence of sparse rewards in practical applications and highlight recent breakthroughs (e.g., solving Montezuma's Revenge) to underscore urgency.",
        "Sparse rewards are framed as a subset of broader RL challenges where exploration is essential to overcome local optima and reward sparsity, establishing significance for sample efficiency and real-world deployment.",
        "Contributes to reinforcement learning, machine learning, and interdisciplinary fields involving autonomous decision-making systems."

      "Methodology": [
        "Categorizes exploration methods into seven groups (e.g., reward novel states, goal-based methods) and sub-categories (e.g., prediction error, count-based). Performance is evaluated via benchmarks like Atari and Mujoco.",
        "Categorization offers a novel, rational structure for comparing methods. Applicability is demonstrated through benchmark results, but some techniques require problem-specific adaptations (e.g., state representations).",
        "Data sources are existing RL benchmarks (e.g., Atari images, Mujoco joint angles). Their representativeness is validated via widespread adoption, though real-world transferability remains limited.",
        "Qualitative comparison based on literature; no new experiments. Evaluation metrics include scores on benchmarks (e.g., Montezuma's Revenge), complexity, and computational effort.",
        "Follows the RL theoretical paradigm, emphasizing model-free/model-based distinctions. This perspective centers on agent-environment interactions but may overlook alternative learning frameworks."
