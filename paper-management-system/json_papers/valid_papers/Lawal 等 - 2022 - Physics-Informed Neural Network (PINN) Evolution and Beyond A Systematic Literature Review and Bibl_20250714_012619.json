    "abstract": "This research aims to study and assess state-of-the-art physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from different researchers’ perspectives. The PRISMA framework was used for a systematic literature review, and 120 research articles from the computational sciences and engineering domain were specifically classified through a well-defined keyword search in Scopus and Web of Science databases. Through bibliometric analyses, we have identified journal sources with the most publications, authors with high citations, and countries with many publications on PINNs. Some newly improved techniques developed to enhance PINN performance and reduce high training costs and slowness, among other limitations, have been highlighted. Different approaches have been introduced to overcome the limitations of PINNs. In this review, we categorized the newly proposed PINN methods into Extended PINNs, Hybrid PINNs, and Minimized Loss techniques. Various potential future research directions are outlined based on the limitations of the proposed solutions.",
    "methodology": "Systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework; bibliometric analysis of 120 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases focused on computational sciences and engineering.",
    "conclusion": "PINNs face limitations like high training costs and poor scalability. New techniques (Extended, Hybrid, Minimized Loss PINNs) address these but have their own constraints. Bibliometric analysis shows growing research since 2019, led by the US, China, and Europe. Future work should focus on overcoming new method limitations and expanding applications.",
