    "abstract": "The CIRCLES project aims to reduce instabilities in traffic flow, which are naturally occurring phenomena due to human driving behavior. Also called 'phantom jams' or 'stop-and-go waves,' these instabilities are a significant source of wasted energy. Toward this goal, the CIRCLES project designed a control system, referred to as the MegaController by the CIRCLES team, that could be deployed in real traffic. Our field experiment, the MegaVanderTest (MVT), leveraged a heterogeneous fleet of 100 longitudinally controlled vehicles as Lagrangian traffic actuators, each of which ran a controller with the architecture described in this article.",
    "methodology": "The MegaController is a hierarchical control architecture that consists of two main layers. The upper layer is called the Speed Planner and is a centralized optimal control algorithm. It assigns speed targets to the vehicles, conveyed through the LTE cellular network. The lower layer is a control layer, running on each vehicle. It performs local actuation by overriding the stock adaptive cruise controller, using the stock onboard sensors.",
    "conclusion": "The CIRCLES project successfully deployed 100 longitudinally-controlled connected and automated vehicles in live traffic to demonstrate a reduction of traffic flow instabilities. The modular and hierarchical control algorithm, featuring a server-side Speed Planner and a vehicle-side Vehicle Controller, facilitated the use of a heterogeneous vehicle fleet and allowed for multiple approaches to be developed and tested.",
