    "abstract": "This study examines the relevant 3GPP specifications to provide a coherent comparison between the current 5G NR deployments and the NR-V2X sidelink from the point of view of physical layer (L1) software and digital signal processing. The study aims to provide a coherent comparison between these two technologies while also providing an analysis of what kind of implications this new technology has on the physical layer software implementation and the potential problems that should be considered in an NR-V2X implementation. To achieve this, the current 5G NR functionality is compared to NR-V2X functionality using the technical specifications given in 3GPP releases 16 and 17. Some release 18 documents are also considered to point out important upcoming changes which a V2X developer should be aware of, but these are not examined in detail. In short, the study examines the sidelink related changes introduced by NR-V2X specifications in contrast to existing base station-to-UE NR communications. The findings of this study indicate that NR-V2X sidelink largely re-uses the concepts and techniques present in 5G NR communications. Based on the L1 comparison, it could be said that NR-V2X is essentially a simplified version of the existing 5G NR, with some V2X specific additions. Although the sidelink communication path reuses many 5G NR concepts, it also introduces many new concepts that an L1 developer should be aware of. The results also indicate that the specification documents include some problem points, such as functionalities that have strict timing requirements, but the proposed algorithms to achieve these functionalities are nondeterministic in their execution time. This study is carried out as a literature review. More specifically, it follows a narrative literature review approach.",

    "conclusion": "NR-V2X sidelink largely re-uses 5G NR concepts, acting as a simplified version with V2X-specific additions. It introduces new concepts for L1 developers and highlights potential challenges such as nondeterministic execution times for algorithms with strict timing requirements.",

        "The research addresses broader challenges in intelligent transport systems (ITS) for improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and autonomous driving, highlighting limitations of previous technologies like DSRC and LTE-V2X.",
        "Motivation stems from the need to understand differences between 5G NR and NR-V2X for physical layer software implementation, identifying specific problems such as timing constraints in specifications.",
        "The authors argue for necessity by emphasizing the rapid evolution of V2X technologies and the urgency for reliable, low-latency communication in safety-critical applications like vehicle platooning and automated driving.",
        "The specific problem of physical layer comparison is linked to the broader challenge of enhancing ITS reliability, establishing significance through potential reductions in accidents and improved traffic management.",

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts include sidelink (direct device-to-device communication without base station involvement), PC5 interface (for sidelink communications), and casting types (broadcast, groupcast, unicast) defining communication modes.",
        "Sidelink enables communication via the PC5 interface, with casting types determining how data is directed; groupcast and unicast support HARQ feedback, unlike broadcast.",
        "Key assumptions include reliance on 3GPP specifications as authoritative sources, and that UEs (e.g., vehicles) support V2X communication modes with predefined configurations.",
        "The paper makes a descriptive contribution by synthesizing and comparing existing knowledge, aiding developers in understanding NR-V2X implementation nuances."
