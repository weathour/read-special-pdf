    "abstract": "Controlling electromagnetic waves and information simultaneously by information metasurfaces is of central importance in modern society. Intelligent metasurfaces are smart platforms to manipulate the wave information matter interactions without manual intervention by synergizing engineered ultrathin structures with active devices and algorithms, which evolve from the passive composite materials for tailoring wave matter interactions that cannot be achieved in nature. Here, we review the recent progress of intelligent metasurfaces in wave information matter controls by providing the historical background and underlying physical mechanisms. Then we explore the application of intelligent metasurfaces in developing novel wireless communication architectures, with particular emphasis on metasurface-modulated backscatter wireless communications. We also explore the wave-based computing by using the intelligent metasurfaces, focusing on the emerging research direction in intelligent sensing. Finally, we comment on the challenges and highlight the potential routes for the further developments of the intelligent metasurfaces for controls, communications and computing.",
