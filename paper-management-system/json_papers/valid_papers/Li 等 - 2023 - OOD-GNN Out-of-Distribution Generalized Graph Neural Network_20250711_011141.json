    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive performance when testing and training graph data come from identical distribution. However, existing GNNs lack out-of-distribution generalization abilities. This work proposes OOD-GNN, which employs a nonlinear graph representation decorrelation method using random Fourier features and sample reweighting to eliminate statistical dependence between relevant/irrelevant representations. A global-local weight estimator ensures efficient weight learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate OOD-GNN's superiority under distribution shifts.",
