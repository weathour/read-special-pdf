    "abstract": "With the development of communication and automation technologies, the great energy-saving potential of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has gradually been highlighted. By means of interactions with surrounding vehicles and infrastructure, CAVs can automatically plan ecological driving behaviours to significantly reduce energy consumption, which is normally defined as eco-driving. Currently, eco-driving is recognised as an effective method to improve the energy economy of individual CAVs and promote the overall energy economy of transportation without requiring significant hardware investment. After reviewing the scattered eco-driving literature, this study systematically summarizes the state-of-the-art in this field for promoting its future development. The basic principles of eco-driving and energy management systems are firstly discussed to figure out the relationship between eco-driving and powertrain control. Then, related eco-driving studies are classified into three categories according to their applications in terms of single-vehicle scenario, car-following operation, and multi-vehicle co-operation. The key characteristics of various eco-driving studies are in-depth addressed, and the energy-saving potential for cooperative eco-driving is emphasized. Finally, the potential development trends are provided, thereby contributing to the development of eco-driving techniques.",
    "methodology": "The paper reviews methodologies including optimization-based techniques such as Dynamic Programming (DP), Model Predictive Control (MPC), Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP), and Legendre Pseudo-spectral (LPS) methods, as well as machine learning approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). It also covers hierarchical frameworks for co-optimizing eco-driving with energy management strategies, predictive control for traffic uncertainties, and cooperative algorithms for multi-vehicle scenarios.",
    "conclusion": "The paper concludes that eco-driving control significantly reduces energy consumption (up to 20-40% in various scenarios), emphasizes the necessity of integrating eco-driving with energy management strategies for optimal performance, highlights the high energy-saving potential of cooperative multi-vehicle approaches, and identifies future research directions including co-optimization, adaptive methods for mixed traffic, and experimental validation.",
