    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach for mixed vehicle platoons (MVPs), which achieves driving safety, asymptotic stability, and traffic wave dissipation simultaneously. The longitudinal dynamics model and safety constraints are first established for each vehicle. The MVPs are divided into several sub-platoons according to the distribution of connected-and-automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Then, a compound controller to ensure the head-to-tail string stability of MVPs is constructed as a reference controller for the subsequent design of the double-layer distributed model predictive controller (DL-DMPC). To describe the behavior of human drivers, a car-following model specific to HDVs is developed. On the basis of the designed compound controller and the description of HDVs, the DL-DMPC is proposed. The first layer improves tracking performance and satisfies the state constraints of each CAV under different communication topologies through an optimization problem. The second layer utilizes controller-matching technology to ensure the asymptotic stability of vehicle platoons and dissipate traffic waves. With the above double-layer structure, the DL-DMPC can simultaneously address multiple tasks and is applicable in various communication topologies. Simulations and analyses based on the NGSIM dataset are conducted in various scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the developed approach.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes a double-layer distributed model predictive control (DL-DMPC) approach. The first layer focuses on tracking performance and state constraints under different communication topologies, while the second layer ensures asymptotic stability and traffic wave dissipation using controller-matching technology. The approach integrates a compound controller for string stability and a car-following model for HDVs.",
    "conclusion": "The DL-DMPC effectively achieves driving safety, asymptotic stability, and traffic wave dissipation in mixed vehicle platoons. Simulations validate its performance across various scenarios, demonstrating its applicability in diverse communication topologies.",
