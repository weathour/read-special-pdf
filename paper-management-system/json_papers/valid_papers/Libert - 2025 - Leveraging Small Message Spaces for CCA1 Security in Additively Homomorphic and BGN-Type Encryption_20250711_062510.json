    "abstract": "We show that the smallness of message spaces can be used as a checksum allowing to hedge against CCA1 attacks in additively homomorphic encryption schemes. We first show that the additively homomorphic variant of Damgård's Elgamal provides IND-CCA1 security under the standard DDH assumption. Earlier proofs either required non-standard assumptions or only applied to hybrid versions of Damgård's Elgamal, which are not additively homomorphic. Our security proof builds on hash proof systems and exploits the fact that encrypted messages must be contained in a polynomial-size interval to enable decryption. With 3 group elements per ciphertext, this positions Damgård's Elgamal as the most efficient compact DDH-based additively homomorphic CCA1 cryptosystem. We extend this observation to build an IND-CCA1 variant of the Boneh-Goh-Nissim encryption scheme, which allows evaluating 2-DNF formulas on encrypted data. Using similar ideas, we also obtain CCA1 variants of Elgamal-Paillier and Castagnos-Laguillaumie systems with minimal overhead.",

    "conclusion": "1. Damgård's Elgamal achieves IND-CCA1 under DDH with 3 group elements/ciphertext, outperforming prior schemes. 2. A CCA1-secure BGN variant reduces ciphertexts to 9 elements (vs 16 in lite Cramer-Shoup). 3. Elgamal-Paillier and Castagnos-Laguillaumie modifications achieve CCA1 with exponentially large message spaces and no ciphertext expansion. 4. Small message spaces act as implicit checksums against adaptive attacks.",

      "Overview": "This paper develops efficient IND-CCA1-secure homomorphic encryption schemes under standard assumptions by exploiting restricted message spaces. It focuses on additively homomorphic encryption (e.g., Damgård's Elgamal) and BGN-type systems for quadratic functions, providing new security proofs and constructions that improve ciphertext size and computational efficiency.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Homomorphic encryption schemes are inherently malleable and vulnerable to adaptive attacks, making CCA2 security unattainable. CCA1 security (non-adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks) remains desirable for key-recovery attack resistance.",
        "Prior CCA1 schemes either relied on non-standard assumptions, lacked compactness, or offered marginal efficiency gains over CCA2 constructions. The paper aims to close this gap by leveraging small message spaces as implicit integrity checks.",
        "The authors argue that existing efficiency barriers (e.g., Lipmaa's impossibility result for Damgård's Elgamal under DDH) can be bypassed when messages are integers in polynomial-size intervals, establishing urgency for new proofs.",
        "The work addresses broader challenges in practical homomorphic encryption by reducing ciphertext sizes and computational costs while maintaining security under standard assumptions.",
        "Contributions span cryptography, specifically homomorphic encryption, with interdisciplinary links to algorithm design and computational complexity."

        "Restricting messages to M ensures malformed ciphertexts are detected during decryption. This integrates with hash proof systems to prove CCA1 security, where M's sparsity in a larger group guarantees rejection of invalid ciphertexts with high probability.",
        "Assumes DDH/SXDH hardness; messages in M are efficiently recognizable; homomorphic operations preserve correctness only if outputs stay in M.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods: Game-based security proofs under DDH/SXDH; modifications to Damgård's Elgamal (DEG), BGN, and Elgamal-Paillier; ciphertext integrity via plaintext validation during decryption.",
        "Novelty: Uses message-space restrictions as implicit checksums instead of authenticated encryption. Applicability: Extends to multiple cryptosystems. Rationality: Aligns with standard cryptographic paradigms (e.g., hash proof systems).",
        "Synthetic/analytical: DEG uses discrete-log groups; BGN uses bilinear pairings; Elgamal-Paillier uses composite residuosity. Message spaces are polynomial-size intervals; no physical data preprocessing required.",
        "Experimental design: Rigorous game sequences with statistical bounds (e.g., adversary advantage ≤ Q(B+1)/2^λ). Evaluation: Reductions to DDH/SXDH/DCR; ciphertext size and operation count comparisons.",

      "Results": [

        "Results are significant: Resolve long-standing open problems (e.g., DEG's security under standard assumptions). Reliability: Proven via tight reductions; stability: Techniques generalize across schemes (DEG, BGN, Paillier)."

        "Strengths: Reductions to standard assumptions; unified framework for multiple schemes. Weaknesses: Message-space restrictions limit functionality. Rebuttals: Argue M remains large enough for practical use (e.g., exponential in λ for Paillier)."
