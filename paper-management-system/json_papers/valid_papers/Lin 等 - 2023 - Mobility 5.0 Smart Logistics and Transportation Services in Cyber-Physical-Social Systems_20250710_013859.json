    "abstract": "The logistics and transportation industry has made significant progress in improving sustainability, efficiency, and accessibility, primarily due to the continuous development of technologies, including clean energy, advanced algorithms, unmanned vehicles, and privacy-enhancing techniques. Along with these advancements, the Mobility 5.0 paradigm has been proposed in the ITSS Intelligent Vehicle 5.0 project meeting. This letter discusses the changes in the supply and demand of mobility resources and looks at the basic components on which the implementation of the Mobility 5.0 relies on. By integrating emerging technologies into Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS), we believe that Mobility 5.0 has tremendous potential in shaping a new era of intelligent logistics and transportation services and will bring significant benefits to individuals, businesses, the government, and the entire society.",
