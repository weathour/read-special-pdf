    "abstract": "The recent proliferation of computing technologies (e.g., sensors, computer vision, machine learning, and hardware acceleration) and communication mechanisms (e.g., DSRC, C-V2X, 5G) has advanced autonomous driving. The key to success is making reliable real-time decisions. However, accidents from early deployments reveal current systems' inability to handle complex real-world environments. This article presents state-of-the-art computing systems for autonomous driving, covering seven performance metrics, nine key technologies, and twelve challenges to realize full autonomy.",
    "methodology": "Survey and analysis of existing architectures, technologies, and challenges in autonomous driving computing systems. Modular and end-to-end designs are compared, with metrics and technologies evaluated through literature review and case studies (e.g., fatalities, sensor comparisons).",
    "conclusion": "Current autonomous driving computing systems face significant challenges in reliability, safety, and real-world complexity. Twelve critical challenges—including AI robustness, sensor synchronization, failure detection, adverse condition handling, cybersecurity, cost, and infrastructure integration—must be addressed to achieve Level 4/5 autonomy. Interdisciplinary collaboration between computing and automotive communities is essential.",
