    "abstract": "Traditional machine learning paradigms are based on the assumption that both training and test data follow the same statistical pattern, which is mathematically referred to as Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.). However, in real-world applications, this i.i.d. assumption often fails to hold due to unforeseen distributional shifts, leading to considerable degradation in model performance upon deployment. This observed discrepancy indicates the significance of investigating the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. OOD generalization is an emerging topic of machine learning research that focuses on complex scenarios wherein the distributions of the test data differ from those of the training data. This paper represents the first comprehensive, systematic review of OOD generalization, encompassing a spectrum of aspects from problem definition, methodological development, and evaluation procedures, to the implications and future directions of the field.",
    "methodology": "Systematic literature review and categorization of OOD generalization methods into three segments: unsupervised representation learning, supervised model learning, and optimization. Theoretical connections between methodologies are analyzed, particularly through the lens of causality.",

      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Real-world ML applications violate the i.i.d. assumption due to distribution shifts (e.g., temporal/spatial evolution, selection bias), causing model degradation.",
        "Motivation: Enhance robustness in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving) where errors have catastrophic consequences.",
        "Urgency is argued via empirical evidence: models fail under distribution shifts, sometimes performing worse than random guessing.",
        "The problem is linked to broader ML reliability challenges, with significance established through real-world applicability and systemic vulnerabilities.",
        "Contributes to machine learning, particularly subfields like computer vision, NLP, and interdisciplinary areas involving causal inference and optimization."

        "Logical network: OOD generalization addresses distribution shifts via invariant representations, causal structures, or optimization. Invariance and causality are central to methodological design.",

        "Data sources: Benchmark datasets (e.g., DomainNet, PACS) with domain shifts. Preprocessing includes environment partitioning. Representativeness is limited to studied shifts (e.g., covariate/concept shifts).",
