    "abstract": "This study presents a Cooperative Mandatory Platoon Lane Change (CMPLC) strategy for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) navigating from a Dedicated Lane (DL) to an adjacent General-Purpose Lane (GPL) with Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). The CMPLC strategy involves two lane change steps and a gap widening step. Initially, a safety criterion for lane changes is proposed, integrating the merits of the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and the Gipps model, to constrain the gaps that the CAVs in the platoon can safely move into. Guided by this criterion, the strategy identifies the largest gap in the GPL near the platoon as the target gap in the first step. A subset of CAVs in the platoon performs rapid lane changes into the target gap, avoiding collision with HDVs. The following gap widening step employs a trajectory planning model based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) to widen two gaps in the GPL while considering the uncertain behavior of HDVs. Simultaneously, guided by another two trajectory planning models, the remaining CAVs in the DL sequentially move into their target gaps during the second lane change step. To validate the proposed strategy, a visual simulation platform integrating SUMO and MATLAB was developed.",
    "methodology": "Three-step cooperative strategy (two lane changes + gap widening), safety criterion combining Intelligent Driver Model and Gipps model, trajectory planning using Model Predictive Control (MPC), simulation via SUMO-MATLAB integration.",
    "conclusion": "The CMPLC strategy achieves higher lane change success rates (100% vs 75%) and shorter execution times (avg. 31.1s vs 57.6s) compared to Individual Vehicle Lane Change (IVLC) baseline. It maintains platoon formation after lane changes, minimizes HDV disruption, and identifies critical lane-change points for early warnings across traffic scenarios.",
