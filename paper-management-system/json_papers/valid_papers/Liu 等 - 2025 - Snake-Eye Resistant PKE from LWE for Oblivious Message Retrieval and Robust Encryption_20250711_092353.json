    "abstract": "Oblivious message retrieval (OMR) allows resource-limited recipients to outsource the message retrieval process without revealing which messages are pertinent to which recipient. Its realizations in recent works leave an open problem: can an OMR scheme be both practical and provably secure against spamming attacks by malicious senders (i.e., DoS-resistant) under standard assumptions? In this paper, we present DoS-PerfOMR: a provably DoS-resistant OMR construction that is 12x faster than OMRp2 (a conjectured DoS-resistant OMR construction in prior works), and (almost) matches the performance of the state-of-the-art OMR scheme that is not DoS-resistant (proven by the attacks we show). To achieve this, we analyze the snake-eye resistance property for general PKE schemes, i.e., whether it is hard to encrypt an identical message under two public keys. We construct a new lattice-based PKE scheme: LWEmongrass, that is provably snake-eye resistant and has better efficiency than the PVW scheme underlying OMRp2. We also show that natural candidates (e.g., RingLWE PKE) are not snake-eye resistant. Furthermore, we show that a snake-eye resistant PKE scheme implies a robust PKE scheme, thus introducing the first robust lattice-based PKE scheme without relying on the KEM-DEM paradigm, avoiding its inherent inefficiencies.",
    "methodology": "The paper constructs a new lattice-based public key encryption (PKE) scheme (LWEmongrass) using a hybrid of uniform and short secrets. It introduces two new LWE variants (corLWE and rhLWE) with side information, reduces standard LWE to these variants, and proves security properties under LWE. For OMR, it combines LWEmongrass with fully homomorphic encryption (BFV scheme) and optimizations from prior work. Implementation and evaluation are performed in C++.",
    "conclusion": "The paper resolves the open problem of achieving practical and provably DoS-resistant OMR under standard LWE assumptions. It proves the snake-eye conjecture for PVW/Regev05 PKE, constructs an efficient snake-eye resistant PKE (LWEmongrass), and builds DoS-PerfOMR—12x faster than prior DoS-resistant schemes and comparable to non-resistant ones. It also shows snake-eye resistance enables efficient robust encryption without KEM-DEM.",

      "Overview": "The paper focuses on cryptographic protocols for oblivious message retrieval (OMR), addressing the challenge of building a practical OMR scheme resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by malicious senders. It introduces snake-eye resistance as a key property for public key encryption (PKE) and constructs a new lattice-based PKE scheme to achieve provable security under standard Learning With Errors (LWE) assumptions.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Metadata privacy is critical in encrypted communication systems to prevent leakage via traffic analysis. Recipient privacy—ensuring only senders and recipients know message destinations—is challenging when recipients outsource retrieval to untrusted servers.",
        "Prior OMR schemes lack provable DoS-resistance under standard assumptions, allowing malicious senders to craft messages that appear pertinent to many recipients, forcing resource-intensive processing.",
        "The authors argue that without DoS-resistance, OMR deployments are vulnerable to spam attacks, undermining efficiency and practicality. This urgency is highlighted by demonstrated attacks on non-resistant schemes.",
        "The specific problem of DoS in OMR is linked to the broader challenge of secure outsourced computation, where malicious inputs can exhaust resources. The paper establishes significance by showing real-world feasibility gaps in prior work.",
        "Contributes to cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, secure messaging protocols, and privacy-preserving systems."
