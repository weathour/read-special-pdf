    "abstract": "A significant increase in the use of electronics control units (ECUs) in modern vehicles has made controller area network (CAN) a de facto standard in the automotive industry. CAN standard has been designed without security features, making it vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This work proposes a hybrid deep learning-based intrusion detection system (HyDL-IDS) using spatial-temporal representation for characterizing in-vehicle network traffic. The system employs convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to automatically extract spatial and temporal features from network traffic. Evaluated on a benchmark car-hacking dataset, HyDL-IDS achieves approximately 100% detection accuracy with low false alarm rates for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, fuzzy attacks, and spoofing attacks (Gear and RPM), outperforming traditional methods like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Multi-layer Perceptron.",
    "methodology": "Hybrid deep learning approach combining CNN for spatial feature extraction and LSTM for temporal feature extraction. The system includes: 1) CAN traffic preprocessor for data normalization and encoding, 2) HyDL Detector module with sequential CNN-LSTM architecture for spatial-temporal feature learning, and 3) Fully connected neural network for classification. Preprocessing converts HEX data to DEC, handles missing values, and normalizes features. The model uses binary cross-entropy loss with Adam optimizer.",
    "conclusion": "HyDL-IDS achieves near-perfect detection accuracy (100% for DoS/Gear/RPM attacks, 99.98% for fuzzy attacks) with minimal false alarms. It significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, MLP) and individual deep learning models (CNN or LSTM alone) by effectively leveraging spatial-temporal representations of in-vehicle network traffic.",
