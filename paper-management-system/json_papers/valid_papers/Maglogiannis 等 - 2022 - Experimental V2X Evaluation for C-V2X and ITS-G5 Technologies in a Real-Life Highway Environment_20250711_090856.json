    "abstract": "In the coming years, connectivity between vehicles with autonomous driving features and roadside infrastructure will become more and more a reality on our roads, pursuing to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. In this regard, two main communication standards are considered as key enablers, that is ITS-G5 (based on IEEE 802.11p) and C-V2X (3GPP). To assess the real performance of these technologies, there is still need for an objective and independent one-to-one comparison of these technologies using off-the-shelf hardware under identical and real-life traffic conditions. Until today, performance evaluations are limited to simulations, emulations or individual technology assessments in real-life circumstances. In this paper, an exhaustive and fair evaluation of the technologies has been conducted in a real-life highway environment under identical conditions. Tailored evaluation tools in combination with our in-house CAMINO vehicular framework has been utilized to perform the tests and analyze the results for different well-specified test cases. The performance evaluation shows that for the short-range technologies, C-V2X PC5 has, in general, a higher range than ITS-G5, while ITS-G5 offers lower latency than C-V2X PC5 in low-density scenarios. Long-range 4G C-V2X can be considered as an alternative for certain use cases. The outcome of this experimentation study can be used as valuable information for the further development of future (5G) connected and autonomous driving.",
    "methodology": "Real-life experimental evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf hardware on the Smart Highway testbed, employing in-house CAMINO framework for communication management. Performance assessed via Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including Packet Delivery Rate (PDR), packet-loss, end-to-end latency, and signal strength under identical highway conditions. Tests covered V2I, V2V, security impact, and cross-country interoperability scenarios.",
    "conclusion": "C-V2X PC5 generally provides longer range than ITS-G5, while ITS-G5 offers lower latency in low-density scenarios. Long-range 4G C-V2X Uu suffers from high latency fluctuations, making it unsuitable for safety-critical applications. Software-based security increases latency but remains below 100ms thresholds. Both technologies meet safety service requirements, with environmental factors significantly affecting performance.",
