    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) structures the base of future infrastructures and smart cities but faces security vulnerabilities. This research integrates IoT with cloud and fog computing to support smart city applications, proposing an IoT-Fog-Cloud architecture. For Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) anomaly detection, an Improved Naïve Bayes (INB) classifier based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is developed. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, PCA extracts features while INB classifies attacks. The method achieves 92.48% accuracy and 95.35% detection rate.",

    "conclusion": "Integration of IoT-Fog-Cloud mitigates cybersecurity issues in smart cities. The INB-PCA model significantly improves anomaly detection performance (92.48% accuracy, 95.35% detection rate). Future work should address false positive rates.",
