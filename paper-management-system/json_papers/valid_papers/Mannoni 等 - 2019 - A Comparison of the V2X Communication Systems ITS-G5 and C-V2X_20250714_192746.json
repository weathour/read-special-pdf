    "abstract": "Vehicle to vehicle infrastructure communication systems have a significant role to play in optimizing road traffic and improving road safety. In this context, two standards have emerged, namely ITS-G5 (IEEE 802.11p) and C-V2X (3GPP Release 14). The objective of this article is to compare both standards by evaluating the performance of both physical layers and associated MAC layers. The physical layer performance of a single link is first evaluated and used to derive performance in a loaded network where each user is scheduled by their respective MAC layer. Performance evaluation shows an advantage for the C-V2X for low levels of vehicles density while when the congestion increases the performance gap reduces until ITS-G5 eventually outperforms C-V2X. Finally, latency was also assessed for both communication systems.",
    "methodology": "The paper evaluates the performance of ITS-G5 and C-V2X through simulations of their physical and MAC layers, considering various configurations and network conditions.",
    "conclusion": "C-V2X outperforms ITS-G5 at low vehicle densities, but ITS-G5 performs better under high congestion. Latency comparisons show ITS-G5 has lower latency for shorter ranges, but C-V2X is better for longer ranges.",
