    "abstract": "Automated red teaming holds substantial promise for uncovering and mitigating the risks associated with the malicious use of large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to rigorously assess new methods. To address this issue, we introduce HarmBench, a standardized evaluation framework for automated red teaming. We identify several desirable properties previously unaccounted for in red teaming evaluations and systematically design HarmBench to meet these criteria. Using HarmBench, we conduct a large-scale comparison of 18 red teaming methods and 33 target LLMs and defenses, yielding novel insights. We also introduce a highly efficient adversarial training method that greatly enhances LLM robustness across a wide range of attacks, demonstrating how HarmBench enables codevelopment of attacks and defenses.",
    "methodology": "Design of HarmBench benchmark with 510 harmful behaviors across functional categories (standard, contextual, copyright, multimodal), standardized evaluation pipeline, and R2D2 adversarial training method using persistent test cases and GCG optimization.",
    "conclusion": "HarmBench enables rigorous comparison of red teaming methods; no current attack or defense is uniformly effective; model robustness is independent of model size; R2D2 adversarial training significantly improves LLM refusal robustness.",

        "Growing risks of malicious LLM use (e.g., malware writing, social engineering, biological weapon design) despite existing defenses like manual red teaming.",

      "Methodology": [
        "HarmBench design: 510 behaviors (400 textual, 110 multimodal) across 7 semantic categories; evaluation pipeline with standardized token generation (512 tokens) and Llama 2-based classifiers.",

        "Data: Behaviors curated from LLM policies, filtered for differential harm; validation/test splits ensure metric robustness. Representativeness validated via low searchability (0% for contextual behaviors).",
        "Rigorous design: Fixed evaluation parameters; classifier robustness tested against edge cases; large-scale experiments (18 methods, 33 LLMs).",
        "Aligns with adversarial ML paradigm, focusing on output restriction rather than input perturbation."

      "Results": [
        "No attack/defense is universally effective; R2D2 reduces GCG attack success rate to 5.9% (vs. 30.2% in Llama 2 13B); contextual behaviors show highest ASR.",
        "Results are reliable due to standardized metrics and large-scale validation; stability confirmed via model-family consistency (robustness independent of model size)."
