    "abstract": "Heterogeneous content-based traffic distribution motivates Information-Centric Networking (ICN), where content delivery is of primary interest. However, current work does not address Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for prioritized traffic. This paper extends ICN with data delivery deadline awareness and shapes forwarding decisions to ensure prioritized packet treatment. The proposed QoS Aware-ICN (QoSA-ICN) classifies request priority by codifying a QoSInfo object in interest packets, supports converged best route with multi-hop multi-route forwarding to avoid pre-building route overhead, and expands traffic control mechanisms to manage QoS impact on congestion. Simulations show 3.5x/1.2x improvement in delivery time and 13.5x/4.6x reduction in packet loss versus DRSC-based IP/NDN, while outperforming T-Move, MAP-Me and pNDN in content retrieval time and packet loss reduction.",
    "methodology": "Extends NDN with QoSInfo TLV objects containing priority/timestamp/RTT fields; implements multi-hop broadcasting without pre-built routes; develops cross-layer congestion control with priority queuing; evaluates via ndnSIM/SUMO simulations with parameterized scenarios (density/speed/producer ratios).",
    "conclusion": "QoSA-ICN significantly improves deadline-aware packet delivery, showing 3.5x faster delivery and 13.5x lower loss vs. IP, and outperforms existing ICN QoS approaches. It achieves high priority packet success ratios while reducing retransmissions through integrated congestion control.",
