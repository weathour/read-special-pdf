    "abstract": "The first-order reliability method (FORM) is commonly used in structural reliability analysis but faces computational challenges with complex limit state functions (LSFs), especially implicit partial differential equations (PDEs). This study introduces PINN-FORM, combining physics-informed neural networks (PINN) with FORM to avoid direct computation of structural responses. An adaptive weight strategy balances loss function components, enhancing accuracy. Five benchmark examples demonstrate PINN-FORM's effectiveness in predicting PDE solutions and reliability indices within a single training process.",
    "methodology": "Developed PINN-FORM by integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) with the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM). Designed a novel loss function incorporating PDE residuals, boundary conditions, and FORM optimization objectives. Implemented an adaptive weight strategy to dynamically balance loss components during training. Validated through five benchmark cases including 2D/3D structures and steady/transient PDEs.",
    "conclusion": "PINN-FORM effectively addresses reliability problems with implicit PDE-based limit state functions, eliminating direct computation of structural responses. The method reduces computational burden by solving reliability and PDEs simultaneously during training. Validation across five examples confirms high accuracy and zero function-call requirements compared to traditional methods.",
