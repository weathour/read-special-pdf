    "abstract": "Physics-informed machine learning (PIML), the combination of prior physics knowledge with data-driven machine learning models, has emerged as an effective means of mitigating a shortage of training data, increasing model generalizability, and ensuring physical plausibility of results. In this paper, we survey a wide variety of recent works in PIML and summarize them from three key aspects: 1) motivations of PIML, 2) physics knowledge in PIML, and 3) methods of physics knowledge integration in PIML. We additionally discuss current challenges and corresponding research opportunities in PIML.",
    "methodology": "Comprehensive literature review and structured analysis of existing works in physics-informed machine learning.",
    "conclusion": "PIML effectively integrates physics knowledge to enhance data efficiency, generalization, and physical plausibility of ML models. Challenges include manual selection of physics knowledge, lack of benchmarks, suboptimal NN architectures, and the need for foundation models. Future directions involve automatic knowledge identification, novel NN designs, and comprehensive benchmarks.",
