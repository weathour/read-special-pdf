    "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy systems into modern buildings is essential for enhancing energy efficiency, reducing carbon footprints, and advancing intelligent energy management. However, optimizing RES operations within building energy management systems introduces significant complexity, requiring advanced control strategies. One significant branch of modern control algorithms concerns reinforcement learning, a data-driven strategy capable of dynamically managing renewable energy sources and other energy subsystems under uncertainty and real-time constraints. The current review systematically examines RL-based control strategies applied in BEMS frameworks integrating RES technologies between 2015 and 2025, classifying them by algorithmic approach and evaluating the role of multi-agent and hybrid methods in improving real-time adaptability and occupant comfort. Following a thorough explanation of a rigorous selection process which targeted the most impactful peer-reviewed publications from the last decade, the paper presents the mathematical concepts of RL and multi-agent RL, along with detailed summaries and summary tables of the integrated works to facilitate quick reference to key findings.",
    "methodology": "Systematic literature review using multi-step quality assessment: (1) Article selection from Scopus and Web of Science databases based on citation impact (>10 citations), relevance to RL-based RES control in BEMS, peer-review status, and methodological rigor; (2) Keyword analysis with terms like 'Reinforcement Learning in RES for buildings'; (3) Data collection categorizing publications by RL techniques, RES integration, and application context; (4) Synthesis into comparative tables and thematic summaries.",
    "conclusion": "RL is a transformative approach for optimizing RES in buildings due to its adaptability to renewable variability and dynamic energy demands. Key strengths include real-time optimization of energy consumption and storage, while limitations involve data-intensive training and real-world deployment challenges. Future directions emphasize transfer learning, hybrid methods, and standardized testbeds.",
