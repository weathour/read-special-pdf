    "abstract": "The need for reliable vehicular communication is an essential precondition of future Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS). The C-ITS applications and their diverse requirements necessitate a hybrid approach that combines ad hoc and cellular networks to support seamless and robust connectivity. While the research showed tremendous potential, the successful adaptation of the hybrid approach depends on the optimal understanding of its impact on network and protocol performance in an actual reference scenario. This work, which has practical implications for the field, focuses on creating a realistic representation of the dual-link-enabled Hybrid Vehicular Network (HVN) in the simulator. Several enhancements were implemented into a network simulator, including multiple Radio Access Technologies (multi-RAT) support, models for path loss predictions, static subscribers, background interference, and SINR throughput mapping within a multi-cell environment. We then presented a parameterized data traffic steering algorithm that enables switching between Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) and Long Term Evolution (LTE) RAT based on channel congestion and cell load conditions. The simulation result shows the high potential of a dual-link-enabled hybrid approach and its implications on both networks under realistic vehicular networking conditions. The investigations reveal that an intelligent decision to steer traffic can target balanced connectivity and highly reliable vehicular communication at a reduced network load.",

    "conclusion": "Intelligent traffic steering between DSRC and LTE enables balanced connectivity and reliable vehicular communication at reduced network loads. Partial offloading minimizes LTE impact while maintaining DSRC efficiency.",
