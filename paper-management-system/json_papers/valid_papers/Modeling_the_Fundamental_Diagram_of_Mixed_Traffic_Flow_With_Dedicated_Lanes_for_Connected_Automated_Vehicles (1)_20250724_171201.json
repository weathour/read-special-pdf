    "abstract": "To solve the problems of when to set up connected automated vehicles (CAVs) dedicated lanes and how many CAVs dedicated lanes to set up under different penetration rates of CAVs, this work focuses on modeling the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow with dedicated lanes for CAVs. Firstly, the car-following modes and their proportion of mixed traffic flow without and with CAVs dedicated lanes are analyzed. Secondly, the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow is derived based on car-following models to analyze the traffic capacity with and without CAVs dedicated lanes. Then, the relevant properties of the fundamental diagram with CAVs dedicated lanes are proposed and proved. Finally, the sensitivity of related parameters (e.g., CAVs penetration rate, time headway, and free-flow speed) in the fundamental diagram is discussed. Results show that (1) the increase of CAVs penetration rate and free-flow speed can improve the traffic capacity; (2) the design of smaller CAVs time headway benefits traffic capacity. Moreover, one and two CAVs dedicated lanes of three manual lanes are set to improve the traffic capacity to the greatest extent when the penetration rate of CAVs reaches 0.6 and 0.86, respectively. It is noteworthy that developing CAVs dedicated lanes under a reasonable CAVs penetration rate does not waste resources and increases traffic congestion while improving traffic capacity.",
    "methodology": "The study analyzes car-following modes in mixed traffic flow with and without CAVs dedicated lanes, derives the fundamental diagram model based on car-following models, and evaluates the impact of CAVs dedicated lanes on traffic capacity under different penetration rates of CAVs. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model.",
    "conclusion": "The study concludes that setting CAVs dedicated lanes can significantly improve traffic capacity when the penetration rate of CAVs reaches certain thresholds (0.6 for one lane and 0.86 for two lanes). The increase in CAVs penetration rate and free-flow speed enhances traffic capacity, while smaller time headways for CAVs also benefit traffic capacity. The findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of CAVs dedicated lanes in transportation systems.",
