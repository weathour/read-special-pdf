    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art framework for VANETs, Vehicles in Network Simulation (VEINS), is primarily sparse and fragmented. The combination of VANETs and VEINS can improve road safety, efficiency, and user experience for connected and autonomous vehicles. This research examined existing trends and knowledge gaps to provide actionable insights for technical contexts and researchers. Therefore, this systematic literature evaluation was conducted to create a full classification of the article ecosystem. The literature applies the VEINS framework to simulate and evaluate in-vehicle personalized entertainment recommendations based on real-time traffic data and user preferences. We examine service metrics for VANET-integrated vehicle content exchange. Three databases were consulted throughout this study: Scopus, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore. The databases had extensive VANET-related research built on the VEINS framework. Then, screening was completed based on the services considerations. The topic is thoroughly covered in this categorization. Taxonomy proposes categories and subcategories. The initial group includes papers discussing different aspects of VANET-based VEINS framework applications (35/98 total). The second group consists of pieces that focus on the solution (15/98 total). Network-related articles (48/98 total) make up the final section.",

    "conclusion": "VEINS framework enables VANET service simulation but has realism and scalability limitations. Research gaps exist in security, privacy, and real-world validation. Future directions include enhancing mobility models, integrating edge computing, and developing privacy-preserving protocols for practical deployment.",
