    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication systems have an eminence potential to improve road safety and optimize traffic flow by broadcasting Basic Safety Messages (BSMs). Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) and LTE Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) are two candidate technologies to enable V2V communication. DSRC relies on the IEEE 802.11p standard for its PHY and MAC layer while LTE-V2X is based on 3GPP’s Release 14 and operates in a distributed manner in the absence of cellular infrastructure. There has been considerable debate over the relative advantages and disadvantages of DSRC and LTE-V2X, aiming to answer the fundamental question of which technology is most effective in real-world scenarios for various road safety and traffic efficiency applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these two technologies (i.e., DSRC and LTE-V2X) and related works. More specifically, we study the PHY and MAC layer of both technologies in the survey study and compare the PHY layer performance using a variety of field tests. First, we provide a summary of each technology and highlight the limitations of each in supporting V2X applications. Then, we examine their performance based on different metrics.",
    "methodology": "The paper employs a combination of literature review and empirical field tests to compare DSRC and LTE-V2X technologies. Field tests were conducted using five connectivity-equipped test vehicles to evaluate reliability performances in various real driving scenarios, including different Line-Of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) channel scenarios.",
    "conclusion": "The study concludes that enabling spatial diversity enhances both DSRC and LTE-V2X performance, extending communication ranges. LTE-V2X performs better with smaller packet sizes, while DSRC maintains reliability over longer distances with larger packets. Future research should focus on performance under congested scenarios and the integration of 5G technology for more bandwidth-demanding applications.",
