    "abstract": "Advances in information and signal processing technologies have a significant impact on autonomous driving (AD), improving driving safety while minimizing the efforts of human drivers with the help of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches have solved several real-world problems of complex nature. However, their strengths in terms of control processes for AD have not been deeply investigated and highlighted yet. This survey highlights the power of DL architectures in terms of reliability and efficient real-time performance and overviews state-of-the-art strategies for safe AD, with their major achievements and limitations. Furthermore, it covers major embodiments of DL along the AD pipeline including measurement, analysis, and execution, with a focus on road, lane, vehicle, pedestrian, drowsiness detection, collision avoidance, and traffic sign detection through sensing and vision-based DL methods. In addition, we discuss the performance of several reviewed methods by using different evaluation metrics, with critics on their pros and cons. Finally, this survey highlights the current issues of safe DL-based AD with a prospect of recommendations for future research, rounding up a reference material for newcomers and researchers willing to join this vibrant area of Intelligent Transportation Systems.",
    "methodology": "Comprehensive literature review and performance analysis of deep learning methods applied to seven safety-critical tasks in autonomous driving: road detection, lane detection, vehicle detection, pedestrian detection, drowsiness detection, collision avoidance, and traffic sign detection. Evaluation includes quantitative metrics (F-measure, AP, AUC, accuracy) and qualitative critiques.",
    "conclusion": "DL shows promise for AD safety tasks but faces challenges in computational complexity, real-time processing, robustness in dynamic environments, and generalization. Key recommendations include developing energy-friendly CNNs, improving reinforcement learning for real-world adaptation, enhancing sequence learning for pedestrian activity recognition, advancing edge computing, and prioritizing explainable AI (XAI) and federated learning for privacy-aware knowledge sharing.",
