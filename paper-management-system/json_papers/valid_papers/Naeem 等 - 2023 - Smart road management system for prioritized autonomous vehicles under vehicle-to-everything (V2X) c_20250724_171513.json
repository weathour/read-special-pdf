    "abstract": "This paper works on smart transportation strategy for emergency autonomous and normal autonomous vehicles under the vehicle-to-every-things circumstance. All vehicles are fully autonomous, and all EAV communicate with the help of autonomous intersection management to handle traffic situations. When an autonomous emergency vehicle enters the road, then an autonomous intersection management system assigns this vehicle a high priority and all other autonomous vehicles with low priority. Following the priority queue principle and FIFO rule, all vehicles run smoothly so that there will not be too many collisions occurring on the road. Simulation works are conducted by using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), in which all proposed strategies are performed on different Pakistani routes By-pass Multan, M2-motorway, and Nishtar routes. According to our strategy Simulation result, the M2-motorway route takes 8.50 sec to complete its route for autonomous emergency vehicles, and normal autonomous vehicles take 10.55 sec to complete the route. The results identify that the proposed algorithm for different autonomous vehicles significant in reducing the average time delay caused by the algorithms and the corresponding variance, which shows the efficiency and fairness of the proposed strategy in autonomous intersection management.",
    "methodology": "The study uses Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) to simulate traffic scenarios on different routes in Pakistan. The Autonomous Intersection Management System (AIMS) is employed to manage vehicle priorities and traffic flow, utilizing priority queue and FIFO rules.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed smart road management system effectively reduces time delays for emergency autonomous vehicles (EAVs) and normal autonomous vehicles (NAVs) by prioritizing EAVs and managing traffic flow using AIMS. The M2-motorway route showed the best performance with the least delay time for EAVs.",
