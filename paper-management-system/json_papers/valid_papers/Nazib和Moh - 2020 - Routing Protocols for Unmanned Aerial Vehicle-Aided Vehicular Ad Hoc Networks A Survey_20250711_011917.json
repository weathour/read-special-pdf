    "abstract": "In intelligent transportation systems, a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has a significant impact in enhancing road safety, traffic management efficiency, and in-vehicle infotainment features. Routing in a VANET is hampered by frequent link disconnection for non-line-of-sight communication due to roadside obstacles, high mobility, and frequent topological changes. With the help of three-dimensional movement capability, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can drastically improve the routing experience of a VANET by increasing the line-of-sight probability, better connectivity, and efficient store-carry-forward mechanism. This survey paper presents a comprehensive review on state-of-the-art routing protocols for UAV-aided VANETs, categorizing them into seven groups based on their working mechanisms and design principles. The protocols are critically analyzed regarding advantages, disadvantages, application areas, and future improvements, with qualitative comparisons provided through tables. Open research issues and challenges are also summarized.",
    "methodology": "Comprehensive literature review and qualitative analysis of routing protocols, categorized into seven groups (reactive, hybrid, position-based, DTN-based, security-based, clustering-based, SDN-based). Critical examination of protocols' operational principles, features, and performance metrics through comparative tables.",
    "conclusion": "UAV-aided VANETs effectively address traditional VANET challenges like link disconnections and non-line-of-sight communication. The survey identifies seven protocol categories with distinct strengths and limitations, highlighting UAVs' role in enhancing connectivity through 3D mobility and store-carry-forward mechanisms. Key open challenges include energy efficiency, scalability, security, and real-time adaptability in dynamic environments.",
