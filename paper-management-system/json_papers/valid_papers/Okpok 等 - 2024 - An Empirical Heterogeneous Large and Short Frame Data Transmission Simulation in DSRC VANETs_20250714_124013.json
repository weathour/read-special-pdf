    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel hybrid simulation environment that could aid in researching large data transmission in DSRC VANET, thereby addressing transportation, insecurity, and accident issues within our system by transmitting static large datasets that house images of transportation activities. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to investigate the impact of communication techniques on large data transmission in DSRC VANETs. Our focus is on addressing bandwidth challenges, particularly those related to transmitting image-based information within VANETs. To achieve this, our study combines empirical research, analytical models, and simulation-based approaches. We enhance empirical lab results obtained using static radios by integrating the analytical model with the empirical work and introducing a MATLAB-based mobility model to create a hybrid heterogeneous simulation environment. The core of this hybrid simulation technique lies in the MATLAB mobility simulation environment, which integrates findings from various approaches. Our results indicate that even when introducing large images of Travelers Information Messages (TIMs) with a size of 2300 bytes, there is no significant impact on the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) of Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), even under high vehicle densities. Furthermore, the hybrid simulation approach sheds light on potential trade-offs between frame size and message reception, especially in scenarios with dense traffic. Our superior accuracy compared to both analytical and simulation models, effectively capturing real-world complexities. The novel techniques have paved the way for further exploration of the DSRC VANET transmission bandwidth issue in a heterogeneous simulation environment, potentially enabling further research on disseminating image-based public safety message notifications to transportation users.",
