    "abstract": "A mixed traffic flow with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will persist for a long time. It is essential to utilize the limited road resources of freeways to improve traffic efficiency in the traffic flow environment. To address this issue, this paper proposes an optimization model for freeway lane management strategies. Firstly, three lane management strategies, dedicated lane (DL), general lane (GL), and mixed lane (ML), are introduced. Secondly, the capacity model of different lane management strategies is derived based on headway and its probability. Then, an optimization model for freeway lane management is developed. The objective function is freeway throughput, and the constraints are traffic demand, heterogeneous traffic flow distribution balance, and fair allocation of road resources for heterogeneous traffic flow. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that (1) the throughput of freeway segments increases with the penetration rate (PR) of CAVs; (2) when the PR reaches a certain level, the formation of CAVs platoons has a significant impact on the throughput of freeways; (3) different lane management strategies exhibit significant differences in the throughput of freeways. Given the traffic demand and PR, there is an optimal combination of lane management strategies. Therefore, the proposed model can theoretically support lane management of freeways in the mixed traffic environment.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes an optimization model for freeway lane management strategies. It introduces three lane management strategies (DL, GL, ML), derives capacity models based on headway and its probability, and develops an optimization model with throughput as the objective function. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the model.",
    "conclusion": "The throughput of freeway segments increases with the PR of CAVs. The formation of CAV platoons significantly impacts throughput when PR reaches a certain level. Different lane management strategies show varying throughput efficiencies, with optimal combinations existing for given traffic demands and PRs. The model supports theoretical lane management in mixed traffic environments.",
