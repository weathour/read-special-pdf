    "abstract": "Message-passing graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs), particularly those with equivariant representations such as NequIP, are attracting significant attention due to their data efficiency and high accuracy. However, parallelizing GNN-IPs poses challenges because multiple message-passing layers complicate data communication within the spatial decomposition method. This article proposes an efficient parallelization scheme compatible with GNN-IPs and develops SevenNet (Scalable EquiVariance-Enabled Neural NETwork) based on NequIP architecture. Benchmark tests on a 32-GPU cluster with SiO2 achieve over 80% parallel efficiency in weak-scaling scenarios and nearly ideal strong-scaling performance with full GPU utilization. Performance declines with suboptimal GPU utilization. SevenNet is pre-trained with Materials Project data (SevenNet-0) and validated on 100,000-atom Si3N4 simulations.",
    "methodology": "Spatial decomposition algorithm with restricted communication radius (rc), exchanging atomic positions, node features (forward communication), and energy gradients (reverse communication) between processors. Implemented in SevenNet using PyTorch and e3nn library, interfaced with LAMMPS for MD simulations.",
    "conclusion": "SevenNet enables efficient large-scale MD simulations with GNN-IPs, achieving >80% weak-scaling parallel efficiency and near-ideal strong-scaling when GPUs are fully utilized. Performance degrades significantly with lightweight models or small atom counts due to suboptimal GPU utilization. Pre-trained SevenNet-0 successfully simulates 100,000+ atom systems.",
