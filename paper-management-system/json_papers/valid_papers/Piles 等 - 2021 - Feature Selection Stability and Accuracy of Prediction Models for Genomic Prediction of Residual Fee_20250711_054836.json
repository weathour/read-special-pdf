    "abstract": "Feature selection (FS) is essential in high-dimensional datasets to prevent overfitting and reduce computational demands. This study applied univariate and multivariate FS algorithms combined with parametric and non-parametric learners to predict residual feed intake (RFI) in pigs from genomic data. The goal was to identify optimal combinations of feature selectors, SNP subset sizes, and learners for accurate and stable predictions. Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) served as the benchmark. Results showed that support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting (GB) using ≥500 SNPs achieved the highest accuracy (Spearman correlation: 0.28 for SVM, 0.27 for GB) and stability. For small SNP subsets (50–250), Spearman correlation (spearcor) and maximal relevance minimal redundancy (mrmr) filters outperformed other methods, suggesting their utility for low-density SNP chip design.",
    "methodology": "1. Data: 5,708 pigs genotyped with 46,610 SNPs (post-QC: 9,523 SNPs). RFI calculated from adjusted phenotypes. 2. Feature Selection: Filter methods (univ.dtree, spearcor, cforest, mrmr, random), embedded methods (LASSO, elastic net), and hybrid approaches. 3. Learners: SVM, GB, ridge regression, LASSO, elastic net, GBLUP. 4. Evaluation: Nested 10-fold cross-validation; accuracy measured via median Spearman correlation (SC), stability via interquartile range (IQR). FS stability assessed using Nogueira's estimator (NOG).",
    "conclusion": "SVM and GB with ≥500 SNPs achieved the highest prediction accuracy and stability. For small SNP subsets (50–250), spearcor and mrmr filters yielded accuracy comparable to larger subsets, enabling cost-effective genomic evaluation. These filters also demonstrated high FS stability, making them suitable for designing low-density SNP chips.",
