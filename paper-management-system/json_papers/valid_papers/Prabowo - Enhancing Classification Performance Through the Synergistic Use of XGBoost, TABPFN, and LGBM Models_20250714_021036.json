    "abstract": "This research presents a new approach for classification optimization by comparing three algorithms, namely XGBoost (XGB), TABPFN, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). Through a series of experiments, this research shows the contribution of this combination of models. In the problem of Time Aware, the Bayesian Personalized Ranking with Factorization Machines (TABPFN) classification algorithm has had a good influence. TABPFN was corroborated by Ari Smith and Lee (2018), who were the enhanced predictive capabilities of TABPFN compared to its predecessor 7. Furthermore, based on research from Kim and Clark (2020), this research outlines the role of algorithms on comprehensive datasets for more optimal accuracy 8. Patel and Wang (2022) then provide a deeper understanding of TABPFN's superior feature: its integration with temporal dynamics, although not without the associated computing 9. By comparing three algorithm models, the researchers succeeded in increasing Balanced Log Loss in k-fold5 by 0.16, better than XGBoost and TABPFN for this research. Researchers believe that, cumulatively, this model has a positive impact on the future of recommendation systems.",
    "methodology": "The study compares XGBoost, TABPFN, and LGBM models using k-fold cross-validation with five folds. Preprocessing involves reducing irrelevant classes and applying One Hot Encoding to handle categorical data. Evaluation is based on the Balanced Log Loss metric to account for class imbalance.",
    "conclusion": "LGBM outperforms XGBoost and TABPFN in terms of Balanced Log Loss, demonstrating better stability and performance. However, the dataset is small, suggesting future work with larger datasets and potential integration of the three algorithms for more robust classification solutions.",

        "Results are significant for identifying LGBM as a superior classifier; reliability is moderate due to k-fold validation, but stability is questioned as variations occur, and dataset size limits robustness."
