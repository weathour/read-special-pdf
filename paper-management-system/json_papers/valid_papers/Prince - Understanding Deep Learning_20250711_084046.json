    "abstract": "This book introduces the principles behind deep learning, covering deep neural network models, training methods, performance measurement, and improvement techniques. It explores specialized architectures for images, text, and graph data, generative models, reinforcement learning, and examines why deep learning works despite theoretical challenges. The final chapter discusses AI ethics.",
    "methodology": "Conceptual and mathematical exposition of deep learning principles using illustrative examples, theoretical frameworks, and architectural descriptions without code implementations.",
    "conclusion": "Deep learning revolutionizes AI through powerful neural network models but requires ethical consideration. Its success stems from fitting complex functions to data despite theoretical paradoxes like training with fewer examples than parameters.",
