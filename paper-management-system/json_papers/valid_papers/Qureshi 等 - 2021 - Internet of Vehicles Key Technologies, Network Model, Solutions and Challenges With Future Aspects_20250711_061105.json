    "abstract": "New integrated technologies have changed various existing fields and converted into new and advanced data communication systems including, smart agriculture, smart homes, smart health, and smart transportation systems. Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved a new theme to vehicular networks field known as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This paper presents a comprehensive review and detailed background and motivation to evolve the heterogeneous vehicular networks. Paper also proposed new integrated models and key technologies related to network maintenance, a six-layered architecture model based on protocol stack and network elements, network model based on cloud services, big data analytical model based on data acquisition and analytics, security model based on detection and prevention systems. Paper also envisioned existing challenges and future directions to design the new integrated models.",
