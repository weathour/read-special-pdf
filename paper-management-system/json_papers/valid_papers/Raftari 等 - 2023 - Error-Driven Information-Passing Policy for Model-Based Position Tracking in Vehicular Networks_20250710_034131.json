    "abstract": "The paper proposes a decentralized error-driven content passing scheme for model-based position tracking in vehicular networks to address scalability issues in congested urban areas. It introduces a Bayesian non-parametric Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for trajectory prediction and compares it with a kinematic constant acceleration model. Through simulations using Safety Pilot Model Deployment data, the approach reduces position tracking error by 53% compared to distance-dependent methods.",
