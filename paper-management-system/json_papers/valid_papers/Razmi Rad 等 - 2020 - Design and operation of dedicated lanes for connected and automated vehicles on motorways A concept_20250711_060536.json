    "abstract": "Dedicated Lanes (DLs) have been proposed as a potential scenario for the deployment of Automated and/or Connected Vehicles (C/AVs) on the road network. However, evidence-based knowledge regarding the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency is limited. In order to develop an adequate design for DLs, first, a conceptual framework describing the relations and interrelations between these factors and traffic safety and efficiency is needed. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework accounting for the factors that could affect the safety and efficiency of DLs. This conceptual framework is underpinned based on relevant literature on how the deployment of C/AVs, driver behaviour, and DL design and operation affect traffic safety and efficiency. Based on the conceptual framework, the knowledge gaps on DL design for C/AVs were identified and a research agenda, including prioritization of the research needs, is proposed.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and conceptual framework development, supported by analysis of 83 scientific articles. The framework integrates factors affecting traffic safety and efficiency, including DL design configurations, driver behavior, and C/AV deployment.",
    "conclusion": "DLs improve traffic efficiency and safety at higher market penetration rates (MPRs) but degrade performance at low MPRs. Key gaps include understanding behavioral adaptation during control transitions, combined safety-efficiency impacts, and optimal DL configurations. Future research should focus on vehicle-type specifications for DLs, realistic behavioral modeling, and automated lane-change algorithms.",

      "Overview": "This paper develops a conceptual framework for designing and operating dedicated lanes (DLs) for connected/automated vehicles (C/AVs) on motorways, focusing on interactions between DL configurations, driver behavior, traffic safety, and efficiency. It identifies research gaps and proposes a prioritized agenda.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Rising road traffic causes congestion, safety issues, and environmental degradation. C/AVs offer potential solutions but face deployment challenges in mixed traffic.",
        "Mixed traffic interactions between C/AVs and manual vehicles (MVs) lead to unpredictable behavioral adaptations and efficiency losses. DLs are proposed to mitigate these issues by segregating C/AVs.",
        "The authors argue that current knowledge is fragmented, lacking comprehensive studies on combined effects of DL design, driver behavior, and C/AV capabilities. Urgency stems from imminent C/AV deployment and infrastructure planning needs.",
        "The specific problem of DL optimization is linked to broader challenges of traffic flow stability and safety. DL significance lies in enabling platooning benefits and reducing MV-C/AV conflicts.",
