    "abstract": "This study introduces a control-aware communication framework integrating Event-Triggered Communication (ETC) and Model-Based Communication (MBC) for vehicle platooning systems. The approach reduces communication overhead by 47% compared to Time-Triggered Communication while maintaining control accuracy (e.g., <1% speed variation). Using Gaussian Processes for vehicle state prediction and Model Predictive Control, the method balances communication efficiency and platoon performance under packet loss scenarios.",
    "methodology": "Integration of distributed Event-Triggered Communication (using state-dependent triggering thresholds) with Model-Based Communication (Gaussian Process regression for velocity prediction) and Model Predictive Control for vehicle dynamics optimization.",
    "conclusion": "The ETC-MBC framework significantly reduces communication frequency without compromising platoon control performance, enabling scalable cooperative driving systems with efficient resource utilization.",
