    "abstract": "This paper explores data-driven marketing, its benefits, and challenges to provide insights and a framework for business leaders and marketers to leverage in their marketing efforts. Using a systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis, we examined a sample of 98 studies indexed in SCOPUS to identify research activity on this topic until May 2023. Data-driven marketing and communications have gained popularity as companies and marketers prioritize leveraging consumer and market data to strategize and make informed decisions. Adopting and integrating various technologies into the company s systems is crucial for companies aiming to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. By analyzing and interpreting customer data, companies can implement customer-centered marketing initiatives that enhance their experience and satisfaction with the brand, thus strengthening company-customer relationships. However, data-driven marketing faces several challenges, including consumer privacy concerns, data poisoning, information quality issues, and the need for adequate organizational changes.",
