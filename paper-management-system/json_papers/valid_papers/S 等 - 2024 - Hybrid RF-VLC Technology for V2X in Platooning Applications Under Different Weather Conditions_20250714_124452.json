    "abstract": "The platooning of autonomous vehicles on highways is an emerging concept attracting significant interest due to its potential to enhance highway safety by enabling vehicles to closely follow one another, reducing reaction times for accidents, cooperative adaptive cruise control, mitigating human errors, reducing fuel consumption, and improving traffic utility. This paper proposes the integration of vehicular visible light communication (VLC) or radio frequency (RF) based technology over infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links to support desirable quality of service (QoS) requirements in vehicular platoon networks. We simulate possible integration architectures encompassing RF VLC-based I2V with the RF VLC-based V2V link. The proposed work also explores the benefits and trade-offs of integrating the RF VLC-based I2V with the RF VLC-based V2V, specifically for vehicular platoon networks. We evaluate and compare these proposed architectures in terms of data rate and bit-error-rate (BER) under varying weather conditions. The obtained simulation results demonstrate the potential of this proposed hybrid architecture for I2V and V2V links, which could leverage the strength of standalone RF and VLC technologies. The RF-based I2V and VLC-based V2V hybrid architecture emerge as a standout performer, excelling in terms of communication range and resilience to challenging channel conditions.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes and compares four architectures for vehicular platoon networks: standalone RF, standalone VLC, hybrid RF-VLC, and hybrid VLC-RF. The performance of these architectures is evaluated in terms of data rate and bit-error-rate (BER) under varying weather conditions (clear weather, fog, light rain, and heavy rain) using MATLAB simulations.",
    "conclusion": "The hybrid RF-VLC architecture, which combines RF for I2V and VLC for V2V links, emerges as the most balanced and resilient solution for vehicular platoon networks. It leverages the strengths of both RF and VLC technologies, providing robust communication under diverse weather conditions. This architecture is particularly effective in maintaining high data rates and low BER, making it suitable for real-world vehicular platoon deployments.",
