    "abstract": "In vehicular networks, vehicles carry various types of data that need to be offloaded to the RoadSide Units (RSUs) through Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications when vehicles come into their coverage. Since RSUs are not widely deployed, vehicles have intermittent connectivity with RSUs. The data could be urgent (e.g., accident or emergency health data) requiring immediate offloading. This paper proposes V2I-Q, a V2I data offloading scheme with QoS provisioning using three functions: traffic classification (prioritizing data as high, medium, low), overload control (preventing RSU congestion), and admission control (stopping low-priority offloading to accommodate high-priority data). Performance evaluation shows V2I-Q offloads more high-priority data with lower maximum delay than traditional schemes.",
    "methodology": "Proposes V2I-Q scheme with QoS functions: traffic classification, overload control via load thresholds, and admission control. Models vehicle-RSU connectivity time and offloading capacity. Implements and evaluates in OMNeT++ 5.5.1 with Veins 5.0 and SUMO 1.7.0 frameworks using IEEE 802.11p standard.",
    "conclusion": "V2I-Q outperforms traditional V2I offloading by prioritizing and offloading more high-priority data with lower delay. It achieves similar medium-priority offloading but sacrifices low-priority data performance. Future work will extend the scheme to V2V communications.",
