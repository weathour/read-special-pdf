    "abstract": "We construct a predictor-feedback cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design with integral action, which achieves simultaneous compensation of long, actuation and communication delays, for platoons of heterogeneous vehicles whose dynamics are described by a third-order linear system with input delay. The key ingredients in our design are an underlying predictor-feedback law that achieves actuation delay compensation and an integral term of the difference between the delayed (by an amount equal to the respective communication delay) and current speed of the preceding vehicle. The latter, essentially, creates a virtual spacing variable, which can be regulated utilizing only delayed position and speed measurements from the preceding vehicle. We establish individual vehicle stability, string stability, and regulation for vehicular platoons, under the control design developed. The proofs rely on combining an input-output approach (in the frequency domain), with derivation of explicit solutions for the closed-loop systems, and they are enabled by the actuation and communication delays-compensating property of the design. We demonstrate numerically the control and model parameters conditions of string stability, while we also present simulation results, in realistic scenarios, including a scenario in which the leading vehicle's trajectory is obtained from NGSIM data. All case studies confirm the effectiveness of the design developed.",

    "conclusion": "The predictor-feedback CACC design achieves individual vehicle stability, string stability (L2 stability with respect to speed/acceleration error propagation), and zero steady-state tracking errors for constant leader speeds. It compensates large actuation and communication delays without restricting their values, with effectiveness confirmed through numerical and simulation case studies, including scenarios with real traffic data.",

      "Overview": "The paper develops a predictor-feedback cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) system with integral action to simultaneously compensate for long actuation and communication delays in heterogeneous vehicle platoons. It focuses on ensuring string stability, individual vehicle stability, and regulation using third-order linear vehicle models with input delays.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "String stability is critical for safety and efficiency in vehicle platoons but is compromised by actuation, sensing, and communication delays, especially when both actuation and communication delays coexist and are large.",
        "Existing methods address small delays or single delay types; this work solves the gap by compensating simultaneous large delays via a novel integral-augmented predictor design.",
        "Large delays significantly threaten string stability, making compensation essential. The authors argue that prior works lack comprehensive solutions for heterogeneous platoons under dual large delays, necessitating a systematic approach.",
