    "abstract": "This paper proposes a decentralized control strategy for merging a single cooperative automated vehicle (CAV) into a platoon at highway on-ramps. The strategy combines CACC feedback, gap-opening, and MPC controllers to handle large initial state differences, sensor noise, and disturbances from platoon leaders. It ensures smooth controller transitions, incorporates collision avoidance mechanisms, and achieves efficient, safe merging validated through simulations with communication delays and noise.",
    "methodology": "Combination of CACC feedback control, gap-opening controllers, and model predictive control (MPC) for trajectory planning. Uses virtual transitional CACC controllers for smooth switching between control modes and collision avoidance algorithms for safety.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed strategy outperforms traditional MPC methods in noise handling, safety, and passenger comfort. It successfully merges vehicles under large initial state differences and disturbances, forming steady-state platoons with minimal errors and jerk within acceptable bounds.",
