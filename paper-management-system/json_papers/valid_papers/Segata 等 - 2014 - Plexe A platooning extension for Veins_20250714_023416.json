    "abstract": "Cooperative driving in general and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) or platooning in particular require blending control theory, communications and networking, as well as mechanics and physics. Given the lack of an integrated modeling framework and theory as well as the prohibitively high costs of using prototypes for what-if studies, simulation remains the fundamental instrument to evaluate entire cooperative driving systems. This work presents PLEXE, an Open Source extension to Veins that offers researchers a simulation environment able to run experiments in realistic scenarios, taking into account physics and mechanics of the vehicles, communications and networking impairments, and Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocol stacks. PLEXE is easily extensible and already implements protocols to support platooning and cooperative driving applications and several state of the art cruise control models. We describe the structure of the simulator and the control algorithms that PLEXE implements and provide two use cases which show the potential of our framework as a powerful research tool for cooperative driving systems.",

      "Overview": "The paper introduces PLEXE, an open-source extension to the Veins simulation framework, designed for simulating platooning systems in cooperative driving. It integrates vehicle dynamics, communication networks, and control algorithms to enable realistic studies of applications like Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC).",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The research addresses challenges in intelligent transportation systems, such as improving road efficiency and safety through cooperative driving, but existing tools lack integrated frameworks for evaluating platooning.",
        "Motivation stems from the absence of reproducible, open-source simulators that combine vehicle physics, communication impairments, and control models for large-scale platooning studies.",
        "Authors argue the necessity by highlighting gaps in proprietary or incomplete simulators, which hinder peer review and scalability, emphasizing the urgency for accessible tools to advance CACC deployment.",
        "They relate platooning-specific issues (e.g., formation management, network support) to broader transportation challenges like traffic flow optimization and safety, establishing significance through real-world applicability.",
        "This work contributes to interdisciplinary fields including vehicular networking, control systems, and simulation technologies."
      ],
      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: Platooning (groups of vehicles coordinating movement), CACC (Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control using IVC for enhanced stability), and Simulation Framework (integrated tool for testing maneuvers and controllers).",
        "Logical relationships: CACC enables platooning by leveraging IVC for real-time data exchange; the simulation framework models this interaction, linking vehicle dynamics to communication protocols.",
        "Key assumptions include the importance of realistic physics and communication modeling for accurate simulation, and gradual adoption of automated systems alongside human-driven vehicles.",
        "The contribution is practical, providing an extensible tool that advances knowledge by enabling reproducible experiments and comparative studies in vehicular systems."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods involve extending Veins and SUMO simulators via TraCI interface, implementing longitudinal controllers (e.g., CC, ACC, CACC), and developing protocols for maneuvers like joining platoons.",
        "Methodology is novel in its holistic integration; applicable to mixed traffic scenarios; rational as it addresses limitations of prior tools by combining network realism with vehicle dynamics.",
        "Data sources are simulated environments (no real-world data); preprocessing includes configuring vehicle parameters and communication settings; representativeness is high due to detailed physics and IEEE 802.11p stack emulation.",
        "Experimental design in use cases (e.g., string stability tests) is rigorous with defined metrics like speed oscillation attenuation; evaluation metrics (e.g., distance error, acceleration) adequately assess controller performance.",
        "The research follows control theory and networking paradigms, affecting perspective by emphasizing interdisciplinary integration for comprehensive system analysis."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Key results: Demonstrated string stability in CACC controllers (e.g., disturbance attenuation), successful implementation of a join maneuver with parameter-dependent convergence times, and unstable behavior in fictional controllers like TESTCC.",
        "Results are significant for validating controller designs; reliability is supported by realistic simulation; stability varies with parameters (e.g., faster convergence in CACC with higher damping but potential oscillations)."

      "Argumentation_and_Logic": [
        "Overall structure: Problem statement → literature review → framework description → controller details → use case validation → conclusions.",
