    "abstract": "Cooperative driving in general and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) or platooning in particular require blending control theory, communications and networking, as well as mechanics and physics. Given the lack of an integrated modeling framework and theory as well as the prohibitively high costs of using prototypes for what-if studies, simulation remains the fundamental instrument to evaluate entire cooperative driving systems. This work presents PLEXE, an Open Source extension to Veins that offers researchers a simulation environment able to run experiments in realistic scenarios, taking into account physics and mechanics of the vehicles, communications and networking impairments, and Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocol stacks. PLEXE is easily extensible and already implements protocols to support platooning and cooperative driving applications and several state of the art cruise control models. We describe the structure of the simulator and the control algorithms that PLEXE implements and provide two use cases which show the potential of our framework as a powerful research tool for cooperative driving systems.",
