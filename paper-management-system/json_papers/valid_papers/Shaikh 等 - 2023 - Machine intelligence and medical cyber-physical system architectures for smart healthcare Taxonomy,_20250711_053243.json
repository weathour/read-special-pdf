    "abstract": "The paper explores Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) as critical tools for continuous patient care in hospitals. MCPS are life-critical, context-aware networked systems facing challenges in system software assurance, interoperability, security, and device certification. It positions MCPS as an AI application in healthcare, discussing telehealth systems for chronic diseases, medication management, and tele-homecare. The study analyzes MCPS architecture layers (data collection, aggregation, cloud processing, action), evaluates encryption techniques for data privacy, and identifies computational overhead trade-offs. It concludes with opportunities and challenges for AI-driven MCPS in healthcare.",
