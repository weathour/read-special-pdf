    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything is growing in market demand as a key technology for the Internet of Things (IoT), intended to enhance road safety, traffic efficiency, and energy savings. This high-speed data transfer, low latency, and wide bandwidth capabilities are crucial to V2X interaction optimization, making it the perfect platform for the right scaling effectively, and 5G networks give us technological environment. The article takes a deep dive into V2X communication applications through 5G technologies which enable the deployment of an inclusive, responsive, real-time transport ecosystem. V2X includes several paradigms such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and even a more recent one, Vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), each of which individually provides unique benefits to road-safety and efficiency. The article evaluates how V2X performs and scales on 5G networks compared to older generations of mobile networks using case studies. Furthermore, the narrative explores challenges in implementing 5G-equipped V2X with fragile infrastructure integration: issues with compatibility, as well as security and privacy of information. It also discusses the possible effects of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Finally, the article offers a glimpse into emerging advancements in V2X technologies such as edge computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, potentially revolutionizing vehicle communication systems. for This article serves as a comprehensive manual policymakers, scholars, and researchers in the realm of V2X communications over 5G networks.",
