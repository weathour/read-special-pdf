    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics enable transcriptomic profiling with spatial localization information. Analyzing such data is challenging due to noise and spatial correlation. SpatialPCA is a spatially aware dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional representations preserving biological signals and spatial correlation. It facilitates spatial domain detection, trajectory inference, and high-resolution spatial map construction. Applications reveal key molecular signatures in tumor microenvironments and neuronal developmental patterns.",
    "methodology": "SpatialPCA extends probabilistic PCA by incorporating spatial coordinates and modeling spatial correlation via a kernel matrix. It uses maximum likelihood inference with low-rank approximations for scalability. Downstream analyses include clustering for spatial domain detection and trajectory inference using scRNA-seq tools.",
    "conclusion": "SpatialPCA outperforms existing methods in spatial domain detection and trajectory inference across multiple datasets and technologies. It identifies biologically significant structures like tertiary lymphoid assemblies in tumors and accurately reconstructs high-resolution spatial maps.",
