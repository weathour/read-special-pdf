    "abstract": "Physics-informed machine-learning (PIML) enables the integration of domain knowledge with machine learning (ML) algorithms, which results in higher data efficiency and more stable predictions. This provides opportunities for augmenting and even replacing high-fidelity numerical simulations of complex turbulent flows, which are often expensive due to the requirement of high temporal and spatial resolution. In this review, we (i) provide an introduction and historical perspective of ML methods, in particular neural networks (NN), (ii) examine existing PIML applications to fluid mechanics problems, especially in complex high Reynolds number flows, (iii) demonstrate the utility of PIML techniques through a case study, and (iv) discuss the challenges and opportunities of developing PIML for fluid mechanics.",

      "Overview": "This paper reviews the integration of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) with fluid mechanics, covering methods like physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and PDE-preserving neural networks (PPNN), their applications in turbulent flows, a case study demonstration, and challenges for future development.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) faces challenges such as high computational costs for high-resolution simulations, difficulties in solving inverse problems, and idealized conditions that ignore realistic processes like noisy boundary conditions.",
        "Motivation stems from leveraging ML to address CFD limitations by supplementing domain knowledge, exploring large design spaces, identifying hidden patterns, and managing ill-posed problems, especially in data-sparse regimes.",
        "The authors argue for necessity by highlighting the infeasibility of direct numerical simulations (DNS) for complex turbulent flows with multi-physical processes, and urgency due to rising computational demands and availability of advanced hardware like GPUs/TPUs.",
        "The specific problem of inefficient CFD simulations is linked to broader challenges in scientific computing, establishing significance through PIML's potential to reduce costs and enhance accuracy in fluid flow prediction.",

        "Core concepts: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) integrates domain knowledge with ML; PDE-preserving methods enforce physical constraints in model architecture; invariance ensures predictions adhere to physical symmetries like rotational invariance.",
        "Logical relationships: PIML embeds physics at various stages (inputs, loss functions, architecture) to constrain ML models, improving generalizability; PDE residuals in loss functions or architecture modifications create a network where physics guides data-driven predictions.",
        "Key assumptions include the availability of known physical laws (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) for embedding, sufficient data for training, and that physical constraints reduce model error in sparse-data regimes.",

        "Data sources are high-fidelity simulations (e.g., DNS databases) and experimental data; preprocessing involves feature selection, dimensionality reduction (e.g., POD), and transformations for invariance; representativeness is high for canonical flows but limited for complex turbulence due to data sparsity.",
        "Experimental design includes case studies (e.g., lid-driven cavity) with error metrics like mean-squared error; rigor is adequate for laminar flows but less so for turbulence where evaluation shows higher errors and instability.",
