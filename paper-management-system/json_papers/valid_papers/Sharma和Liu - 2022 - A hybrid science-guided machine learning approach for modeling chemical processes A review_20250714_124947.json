    "abstract": "This study presents a broad perspective of hybrid process modeling combining the scientific knowledge and data analytics in bioprocessing and chemical engineering with a science-guided machine learning (SGML) approach. We divide the approach into two major categories: ML complements science, and science complements ML. We review the literature relating to the hybrid SGML approach, and propose a systematic classification of hybrid SGML models. For applying ML to improve science-based models, we present expositions of direct serial and parallel hybrid modeling and their combinations, inverse modeling, reduced-order modeling, quantifying uncertainty in the process and even discovering governing equations of the process model. For applying scientific principles to improve ML models, we discuss the science-guided design, learning and refinement. For each sub-category, we identify its requirements, strengths and limitations, together with their published and potential applications. We also present several examples to illustrate different hybrid SGML methodologies for modeling chemical processes.",
    "methodology": "The paper reviews and classifies hybrid SGML methodologies into two major categories: ML complements science (direct hybrid modeling, inverse modeling, reduced-order modeling, quantifying uncertainty, discovering governing equations) and science complements ML (science-guided design, learning, refinement). It provides detailed expositions of each sub-category, including their requirements, strengths, limitations, and applications.",
    "conclusion": "The hybrid SGML approach integrates scientific knowledge with data analytics to improve the accuracy and scientific consistency of chemical process models. The paper presents a systematic classification of hybrid SGML models, highlighting their applications in bioprocessing and chemical engineering. It identifies unexplored themes and methodologies, such as using scientific knowledge to improve ML model architecture, and illustrates their potential through industrial examples.",
