    "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems contribute to improved traffic safety by facilitating real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructures. In this context, message authentication is crucial to safeguard vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) from malicious attacks. The current state-of-the-art for authentication in VANETs relies on conventional cryptographic primitives, introducing significant computation and communication overheads. This paper presents a cross-layer authentication scheme for vehicular communication, incorporating the short-term reciprocal features of the wireless channel for re-authenticating the corresponding terminal, reducing the overall complexity and computation and communication overheads. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme even at small signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, the immunity of the proposed scheme is proved against active and passive attacks, including signatures unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attacks in the random oracle model. Finally, a comprehensive comparison in terms of computation and communication overheads demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme over its best rivals.",
    "methodology": "Proposes a four-step cross-layer scheme: 1) Upper-layer authentication using pseudo-identities and elliptic curve cryptography for initial verification; 2) Location-dependent shared key extraction from wireless channel features; 3) PHY-layer challenge-response re-authentication using multicarrier communication and binary hypothesis testing; 4) Threshold optimization feedback to refine key extraction parameters. Integrates cryptographic and physical-layer techniques with simulations for validation.",
    "conclusion": "The scheme significantly reduces computation and communication overheads while maintaining security against replay, impersonation, Sybil, and DoS attacks. It achieves high detection probability (>0.9) at low SNRs (-5 dB) and 70% key mutuality, supports forward/backward secrecy, and outperforms existing crypto-based approaches in efficiency.",
