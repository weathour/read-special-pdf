    "abstract": "The influence of both inter-vehicular communication delays and packet dropouts on platoon control performance is studied. First, the conditions for achieving platoon mean square stability (MSS) are derived for three cases: undirected information flow (UIF) topology with time delays and identical packet losses, general information flow topology (IFT) with time delays and identical packet losses, and general IFT with time delays and non-identical packet losses. These conditions explicitly reveal how packet dropout rates, time delays, and IFT jointly affect vehicular stability. Second, in order to mitigate the impact of time delays and packet dropouts on platoon MSS, some feasible controllers are proposed for each one of the three cases by solving the corresponding modified Riccati inequalities (MRIs). In comparison with existing results, the provided conditions are easily determinable, and the offered controllers are simple to implement, with low computational complexity. Furthermore, they expand upon existing research findings. Finally, simulations are conducted to compare different time delays and packet loss rates, which validate the theoretical discoveries, also demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of the proposed methods using a platoon of passenger cars and realistic vehicle dynamics.",
    "methodology": "The study employs third-order linear discrete-time vehicle dynamics modeling, graph theory for information flow topology representation, and stochastic stability analysis. Key techniques include mean square stability (MSS) criteria derivation, controller design via modified Riccati inequalities (MRIs) and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and decoupling methods for non-identical packet losses using compressed edge Laplacian formulations.",
    "conclusion": "Sufficient conditions for MSS under three communication scenarios (undirected identical, general identical, and non-identical packet losses with delays) were established, explicitly linking stability to topology, delays, and loss rates. Controllers designed through MRIs/LMIs demonstrated low computational complexity and effectiveness in simulations. The work extends prior research by handling simultaneous delays and packet losses while improving implementability.",
