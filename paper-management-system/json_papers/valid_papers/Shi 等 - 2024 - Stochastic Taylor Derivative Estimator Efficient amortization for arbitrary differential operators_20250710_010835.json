    "abstract": "Optimizing neural networks with loss that contain high-dimensional and high-order differential operators is expensive to evaluate with back-propagation due to O(d^k) scaling of the derivative tensor size and the O(2^{k+1}L) scaling in the computation graph, where d is the dimension of the domain, L is the number of ops in the forward computation graph, and k is the derivative order. This work introduces Stochastic Taylor Derivative Estimator (STDE), which efficiently performs arbitrary contraction of the derivative tensor for multivariate functions using univariate high-order auto-differentiation (AD) with randomized input tangents. Applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), STDE achieves ~1000x speed-up and ~30x memory reduction over first-order AD randomization, enabling solution of 1-million-dimensional PDEs in 8 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.",
    "methodology": "Proposes Stochastic Taylor Derivative Estimator (STDE), leveraging Taylor mode AD to compute arbitrary differential operator contractions via randomized input jets. Constructs sparse/dense random jets to estimate operator actions, amortizing costs over optimization while addressing exponential scaling in derivative order k and polynomial scaling in dimension d.",
    "conclusion": "STDE enables efficient computation of arbitrary high-order differential operators in high dimensions. It generalizes prior methods (SDGD, HTE), provides up to 1000x speed-up and 30x memory reduction in PINNs, and solves 1-million-dimensional PDEs in minutes, opening avenues for large-scale applications.",
