    "abstract": "With the rapid evolution in wireless communications and autonomous vehicles, intelligent and autonomous vehicles will be launched soon. Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications provides driving safety, traffic efficiency, and road information in real-time in vehicular networks. V2X has evolved by integrating cellular 5G and New Radio (NR) access technology (i.e., 5G NR V2X) to fulfill demands like ultra-low latency and security. However, deployment faces challenges due to scalability and security issues. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) reduces scalability issues by bringing cloud services closer to vehicles, while blockchain solves security and privacy issues in 5G-based MEC systems. This survey discusses state-of-the-art V2X, its evolution, blockchain integration for security, and future research directions.",
