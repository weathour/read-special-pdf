    "abstract": "In today s world diabetes has become one of the most life threatening and at the same time most common diseases not only in India but around the world. Diabetes is seen in all age groups these days and they are attributed to lifestyle, genetic, stress and age factor. Whatever be the reasons for diabetics, the outcome could be severe if left unnoticed. Currently various methods are being used to predict diabetes and diabetic inflicted diseases. In the proposed work, we have used the Machine Learning algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM)   Random Forest (RF) that would help to identify the potential chances of getting affected by Diabetes Related Diseases. After pre-processing the data, features which influences the prediction are selected by implementing step forward and backward feature selection. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction method is analyzed after the selection of specific features and the accuracy of the prediction is 83  implementing Random Forest (RF) which is significant in comparison with Support Vector Machine (SVM) with accuracy of 81.4 .",
    "methodology": "Data pre-processing with mean imputation for missing values, step forward and backward feature selection to identify influential features, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and classification using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms with a 70:30 data split and 5-fold cross-validation.",
    "conclusion": "Random Forest achieved 83% accuracy in diabetes prediction, outperforming Support Vector Machine at 81.4%. Feature selection improved model efficiency by reducing complexity, but dimensionality reduction via PCA showed limited significance due to the moderate dataset size.",

        "Logical relationships: Pre-processed data undergoes feature selection to extract critical attributes, followed by optional dimensionality reduction, and finally classification to predict diabetes status, forming a sequential pipeline.",
        "Key assumptions: The PIMA dataset is representative of the target population, missing values can be reliably imputed with mean values, and ML algorithms can effectively map features to outcomes.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include mean imputation for missing data, wrapper-based feature selection (step forward and backward), PCA for dimensionality reduction, and RF/SVM classifiers evaluated via accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics.",
        "Novelty lies in the comparative application of feature selection methods to diabetes data; applicability is high for similar healthcare datasets, but rationality is constrained by the dataset's small size (768 samples).",
        "Data sourced from the PIMA Indian diabetes dataset, with 8 features like glucose levels and BMI; pre-processed by replacing missing values with column means. Representativeness is limited to female patients of Pima Indian heritage, potentially reducing generalizability.",
        "Experimental design is rigorous with a 70:30 train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation; metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) are adequate but could be expanded with ROC analysis.",
        "Follows a supervised learning paradigm, specifically classification, which focuses on predictive accuracy but may overlook causal relationships in health data."

      "Results": [
        "RF achieved 83% accuracy after feature selection, with sensitivity of 0.8 and specificity of 0.88; SVM reached 81.4% accuracy. Dimensionality reduction showed minimal impact, with accuracy changes under 3%.",
        "Results are significant for demonstrating RF's superiority in diabetes prediction; reliability is supported by cross-validation, but stability is questioned due to the dataset's limited size and demographic specificity."
