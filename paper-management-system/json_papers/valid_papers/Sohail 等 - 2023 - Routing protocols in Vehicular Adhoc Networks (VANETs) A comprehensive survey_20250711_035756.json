    "abstract": "Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are pivotal for realizing smart cities vision due to their rich services in road traffic safety, surveillance, traffic control, and traffic monitoring. However, vehicle links are subject to frequent disconnections due to high mobility, sparse connectivity, road-side obstacles, and a shortage of roadside units. For this purpose, various routing protocols have been proposed in the literature leveraging the network's topology, the vehicles' positions, and the message dissemination mechanism, i.e., unicast, multicast, broadcast, etc. This paper comprehensively surveys the VANETs routing protocols and analyzes their working principles, architecture, and application areas. Additionally, it presents a taxonomy and a systematic classification of these protocols based on various performance metrics. Furthermore, it presents a critical comparison of these routing protocols according to different criteria, identifies critical shortcomings in each protocol type, and outlines new directions and recent trends in the design of routing protocols.",
    "methodology": "Comprehensive literature review, taxonomy development, systematic classification, and critical comparative analysis of VANET routing protocols.",
    "conclusion": "The paper identifies that position-based routing protocols generally outperform other types in VANETs but highlights persistent challenges such as network disconnectivity, delayed data delivery, and QoS issues. It emphasizes the need for protocols adaptable to high mobility and sparse networks, suggesting future integration with 5G/V2X technologies.",

      "Overview": "The paper surveys routing protocols in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs), classifying them into topology-based, position-based (DTN/Non-DTN/hybrid), anycast, multicast, and broadcast categories. It analyzes their architectures, working principles, and application areas while comparing performance metrics like packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and overhead.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "VANETs enable critical smart city applications (traffic safety, collision avoidance) but suffer from frequent link disconnections due to high vehicle mobility, sparse networks, and roadside obstacles.",
        "To address unreliable communication, diverse routing protocols leveraging topology, position data, and dissemination mechanisms (unicast/multicast/broadcast) have emerged, requiring systematic evaluation.",

        "Protocols are logically grouped by operational paradigm (e.g., topology → proactive/reactive/hybrid; position → beacon/non-beacon). Performance is evaluated against mobility, density, and QoS requirements.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Literature review and comparative analysis: Protocols are dissected by working principles, architecture, and performance in simulations (e.g., NS-2, SUMO).",
        "Novelty lies in comprehensive taxonomy and multi-criteria classification; applicability is validated through real-world VANET constraints (mobility, scalability); rationality is ensured via systematic protocol evaluation.",
        "Data sources: Academic literature (cited protocols) and standardization documents (IEEE, ETSI). Preprocessing involves categorizing protocols by features. Representativeness is limited to studied protocols and simulation-based validations.",
        "Experimental rigor: Simulations vary across studies (e.g., urban/highway scenarios); metrics (packet delivery ratio, delay) are standard but lack unified testing conditions.",

      "Results": [
        "Topology-based protocols (e.g., OLSR, AODV) struggle with high mobility but excel in stability; position-based DTN protocols (e.g., GeOpps) handle disconnections via store-carry-forward; Non-DTN protocols (e.g., GyTAR) prioritize low latency in dense networks.",
        "Results are significant for protocol selection (e.g., position-based outperforms topology-based in mobility); reliability varies by context (e.g., AODV reliable in urban, not highway); stability depends on mechanism (e.g., multipath routing in AOMDV enhances robustness)."
