    "abstract": "The advent of autonomous driving has introduced unprecedented demands on wireless communication systems, particularly in terms of low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity. Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology has emerged as a promising enabler to meet these requirements, leveraging its ability to exploit spatial multiplexing and enhance spectral efficiency. This paper investigates resource allocation schemes based on massive MIMO for autonomous driving applications, focusing on optimizing communication efficiency, ensuring reliability, and minimizing latency. The research encompasses a comprehensive review of existing resource allocation strategies, their applicability to vehicular networks, and potential enhancements tailored to autonomous driving. We analyze the challenges posed by high mobility, dynamic network topologies, and stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in vehicular environments. Furthermore, we explore advanced beamforming techniques, power control, and user scheduling mechanisms optimized for vehicular communication scenarios. A simulation-based evaluation of the proposed schemes demonstrates significant improvements in data rates, latency, and reliability compared to conventional methods. The findings underscore the critical role of massive MIMO in enabling next-generation autonomous driving systems and provide a roadmap for further research in this domain.",
    "methodology": "The paper employs simulation-based evaluation to investigate resource allocation schemes for massive MIMO in vehicular networks, focusing on advanced beamforming techniques (e.g., predictive and machine learning-based), power control mechanisms (e.g., game-theoretic and reinforcement learning-based), and user scheduling strategies (e.g., fairness-oriented, QoS-aware, and cluster-based).",
    "conclusion": "Massive MIMO technology is crucial for addressing autonomous driving communication challenges, with the proposed resource allocation schemes demonstrating significant improvements in data rates, latency, and reliability. Adaptive and intelligent strategies are essential for meeting stringent QoS requirements, and future research should integrate machine learning, edge computing, and conduct real-world validations.",
