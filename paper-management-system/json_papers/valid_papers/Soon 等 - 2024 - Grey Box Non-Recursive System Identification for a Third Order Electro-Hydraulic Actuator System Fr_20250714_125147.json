    "abstract": "Engineering systems heavily rely on mathematical modeling, significantly influencing both system performance and the design of control systems. This paper thoroughly investigates the establishment of a third-order mathematical model for heavy machinery systems, with a specific emphasis on the Electro-Hydraulic Actuator (EHA) system. The formulation of a double-acting EHA system model using a grey box system identification approach is outlined, encompassing the system's dynamics and behavior. In addition, the details of the EHA system experimental setup that is used for system identification are described. The identification process demonstrates promising performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of 89.1%, as highlighted in the results and discussion sections.",
    "methodology": "The research employs a grey box modeling approach for system identification, specifically using a non-recursive least squares algorithm. The methodology includes input signal selection (sum of sinusoidal signals), model validation through graphical and statistical approaches (R-squared and RMSE), and experimental design with a 1 ms sampling interval.",
    "conclusion": "The study concludes that the system identification technique yields a satisfactory accuracy level for the EHA system model, achieving an R-squared value of 89.1%. The derived third-order transfer function model effectively represents the dynamic nature of the EHA system and will be used for tracking performance assessment in future simulations and experiments.",
