    "abstract": "Query-based systems (QBSs) are one of the key approaches for sharing data. QBSs allow analysts to request aggregate information from a private protected dataset. Attacks are a crucial part of ensuring QBSs are truly privacy-preserving. The development and testing of attacks is however very labor-intensive and unable to cope with the increasing complexity of systems. Automated approaches have been shown to be promising but are currently extremely computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practice. We here propose QueryCheetah, a fast and effective method for automated discovery of privacy attacks against QBSs. We instantiate QueryCheetah on attribute inference attacks and show it to discover stronger attacks than previous methods while being 18 times faster than the state-of-the-art automated approach. We then show how QueryCheetah allows system developers to thoroughly evaluate the privacy risk, including for various attacker strengths and target individuals. We finally show how QueryCheetah can be used out-of-the-box to find attacks in larger syntaxes and workarounds around ad-hoc defenses.",

    "conclusion": "QueryCheetah outperforms existing semi- and fully-automated methods by discovering stronger attribute inference attacks while being 18 times faster, enables comprehensive privacy risk evaluation across diverse attacker strengths and target vulnerabilities, and successfully identifies attacks in extended query syntaxes and workarounds for defenses.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Uses a multi-stage local-search algorithm: retains high-importance queries via logistic regression feature scores, generates new queries randomly in syntax stages (limited Q_lim to extended Q_ext), and evaluates fitness through privacy games simulating attacks.",
        "Novelty lies in replacing population-based evolutionary search with faster single-multiset iterations; applicability demonstrated on real QBS (Diffix) and datasets (Adult, Census, Insurance); rationality ensured by incremental syntax exploration and stability analysis.",
        "Datasets: Adult, Census, Insurance; preprocessed by handling missing values (replaced with 'Unknown' for categoricals) and mapping categories to integers; representativeness validated through diverse socio-demographic and insurance data.",
