    "abstract": "Efficient resource allocation is a critical factor in ensuring reliable and low-latency communication in the fifth-generation New Radio (5G NR) sidelink-based Cellular Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) networks. One of the critical challenges in adopting C-V2X systems is the potential for packet collisions between User Equipment (UE) when they share resources in the sidelink channel. For reliable and low-latency communication, especially in safety-critical applications, efficient resource allocation is essential. This paper explores collision-related issues that may arise in the 5G NR sidelink and the probability of collisions on resource blocks. To address these challenges, we propose an experimental time-domain resource allocation strategy leveraging dynamic reselection intervals and adaptive reservation mechanisms. Unlike existing approaches, which primarily rely on static or semi-persistent scheduling, our strategy optimizes resource allocation based on real-time variations in generation time, speed and distance between UEs. The proposed approach significantly reduces collision probabilities, enhances communication reliability and ensures efficient resource utilization, even in high-density vehicular networks. Addressing packet collisions in resource allocation becomes crucial for the viability of vehicular communication systems. The goal of this paper is to analyze the dynamics and causes of packet collisions in C-V2X scenarios using 5G NR sidelink technology and to evaluate how our time-domain optimization techniques can enhance system performance in rapidly evolving vehicular communication networks.",

Simulations conducted via NS-3 5G-LENA integrated with SUMO for mobility modeling, with collision probability modeling accounting for distance, speed, and resource block allocation.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed dynamic time-domain resource allocation strategy significantly reduces collision probabilities and improves Packet Reception Rate (PRR) by optimizing resource utilization based on real-time variations in UE speed, distance, and packet generation time. Optimal communication occurs at ~400m distance, and 4 resource blocks yield the highest PRR.",
