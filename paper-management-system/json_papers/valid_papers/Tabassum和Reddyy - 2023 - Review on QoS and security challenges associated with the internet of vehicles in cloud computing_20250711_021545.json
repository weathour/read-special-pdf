    "abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an area of research and development that has rapidly developed in the VANETs (Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks) that provides smart communication between vehicles and cloud using IoT. Centralized (cloud) and decentralized (edge) computing face challenges of high latency and performance deterioration. IoV-Cloud Computing (IoV-CC) must address security, privacy, and QoS parameters like latency and bandwidth. This research explores data distribution, security acceptability, and future possibilities for these challenges.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and comparative analysis of existing protocols, architectures, and security frameworks in IoV-CC environments.",
    "conclusion": "IoV faces significant QoS and security challenges in cloud computing. Fog computing emerges as a promising solution to reduce latency. Future research must address data dissemination protocols, real-time analytics, and robust security for 5G-enabled IoV systems.",
