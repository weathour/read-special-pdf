    "abstract": "Automated driving such as conventional Cruise Control (CC) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), are gaining popularity. Cooperative ACC (CACC), a cutting-edge ACC system, incorporates local sensors and facilitates information sharing via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, specifically vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), to manage the distance between connected and automated vehicles (CAV) efficiently. It offers a potential solution to enhance transportation systems' safety, mobility, and sustainability. This review examines the transition from ACC to CACC, emphasizing the cooperative approach. It provides an overview of current ADAS solutions, defines CACC, explores control strategies and previous contributions, discusses applications and challenges, and identifies future research areas in vehicular networks.",

    "conclusion": "CACC enhances safety, mobility, and sustainability in transportation by improving platooning efficiency and reducing energy consumption, but future research must address challenges such as robust system architecture, real-world testing, and high implementation costs.",

      "Overview": "The paper is a mini-review on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), covering its evolution from Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), key definitions, control strategies, applications in areas like vehicle platooning and highway merging, challenges, and future research directions in intelligent transportation systems.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "The research background involves advancements in automotive technology, particularly Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, with broader challenges including traffic safety issues, string instability in ACC systems during sudden speed changes, and the need to enhance roadway capacity and fuel efficiency.",
        "The motivation is to address the limitations of ACC, such as the shockwave effect and inability to maintain low time headways safely, by transitioning to CACC, which uses V2X communication for better vehicle coordination and platooning performance.",
        "The authors argue for the necessity and urgency by highlighting that CACC can significantly reduce rear-end collisions, improve traffic flow, and save energy, positioning it as a critical evolution for modern transportation systems facing congestion and environmental concerns.",
        "The specific problem of ACC's instability is linked to the broader challenge of optimizing intelligent transportation systems, emphasizing that CACC's cooperative approach can revolutionize efficiency and safety on a larger scale.",
        "This paper contributes to disciplines including transportation engineering, control systems, communication networks, and automotive engineering, with interdisciplinary elements in vehicular technology and sustainable mobility."

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts include: 1) CACC (Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control) - an extension of ACC that uses V2X communication for real-time data exchange to manage vehicle distances; 2) V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) - communication enabling data sharing between vehicles and infrastructure; 3) String stability - a condition where disturbances in vehicle platoons do not amplify, ensuring safety.",
        "The logical relationship network shows that CACC relies on V2X for information flow, which enables control strategies to achieve string stability, thereby improving platooning efficiency and overall system performance.",
        "Key assumptions include the reliability of V2X communication, accurate sensor data from onboard systems (e.g., radar, lidar), and the feasibility of vehicle cooperation in dynamic traffic environments.",
        "The paper makes a synthetic contribution by reviewing and categorizing existing knowledge, identifying gaps, and proposing future directions, thereby consolidating the field's understanding without introducing new empirical findings."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core research methods involve a comprehensive literature review of CACC systems, analyzing control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and optimal control, and discussing communication protocols like VANETs and VDTNs based on prior studies.",
        "The novelty lies in synthesizing diverse control approaches and applications; applicability is evaluated through real-world examples like truck platooning, but rationality is limited by dependence on simulations and cited works rather than original experiments.",
        "Data sources are derived from referenced academic studies, with characteristics including theoretical models and simulation results; preprocessing involves integrating sensor and communication data, but representativeness is constrained by the lack of empirical data from actual deployments.",
        "As a review, experimental design is not applicable; evaluation metrics adequacy is assessed through cited results showing energy savings and stability improvements, but rigor depends on the quality of the referenced literature.",
        "The research follows control theory and communication paradigms, affecting the perspective by emphasizing technical solutions for cooperative systems while potentially overlooking human factors or socioeconomic aspects."
