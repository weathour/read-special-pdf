    "abstract": "Network slicing is introduced for elastically instantiating logical network infrastructure isolation to support different application types with diversified quality of service (QoS) class indicators. In particular, vehicular communications are a trending area that consists of massive mission-critical applications in the range of safety-critical, intelligent transport systems, and on-board infotainment. Slicing management can be achieved if the network infrastructure has computing sufficiency, a dynamic control policy, elastic resource virtualization, and cross-tier orchestration. To support the functionality of slicing management, incorporating core network infrastructure with deep learning and reinforcement learning has become a hot topic for researchers and practitioners in analyzing vehicular traffic resource patterns before orchestrating the steering policies. In this paper, we propose QoS-driven management by considering (edge) resource block utilization, scheduling, and slice instantiation in a three-tier resource placement, namely, small base stations access points, macro base stations, and core networks. The proposed scheme integrates recurrent neural networks to trigger hidden states of resource availability and predict the output of QoS. The intelligent agent and slice controller, namely, RDQ3N, gathers the resource states from three-tier observations and optimizes the action on allocation and scheduling algorithms. Experiments are conducted on both physical and virtual representational vehicle-to-everything (V2X) environments; furthermore, service requests are set to massive thresholds for rendering V2X congestion flow entries.",
    "methodology": "Proposes RDQ3N (integration of Recurrent Neural Networks and Deep Q-Networks) for intelligent slice management. Uses a three-tier architecture (SBS edge nodes, MBS resource-assisted nodes, core networks) with SDN/NFV. Implements QoS prediction via RNN, action optimization via DQN agent for slice identification, resource allocation, and scheduling. Validated via Mininet-based physical emulation and PyTorch virtual environment.",
    "conclusion": "RDQ3N significantly improves latency, throughput, and resource efficiency for V2X slices (safety-critical, ITS-supported, infotainment). Achieves 14.24ms avg. delay for safety-critical slice (4.99ms lower than benchmarks), 99.46% request acceptance, and balanced throughput across slices. Combines proactive QoS prediction with reinforcement learning for dynamic cross-tier orchestration.",
