    "abstract": "Context Machine Learning (ML) has been at the heart of many innovations over the past years. However, including it in so-called safety-critical systems such as automotive or aeronautic has proven to be very challenging, since the shift in paradigm that ML brings completely changes traditional certification approaches. Objective This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question 'How to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?'. Method We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published between 2015 and 2020, covering topics related to the certification of ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability, Verification, Safe Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Certification. We analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries of the papers extracted. Results The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of ML models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mentioned main pillars that are for now mainly studied separately. Conclusion We highlighted current efforts deployed to enable the certification of ML based software systems, and discuss some future research directions.",

    "conclusion": "Current efforts show community enthusiasm but reveal limitations including dataset/model diversity gaps and disconnected research pillars. Future work requires stronger industry-academia collaboration and integrated approaches across robustness, uncertainty, explainability, verification, safe RL, and direct certification domains.",
