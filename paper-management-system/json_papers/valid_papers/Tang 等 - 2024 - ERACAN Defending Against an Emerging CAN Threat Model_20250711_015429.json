    "abstract": "The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a pivotal communication protocol extensively utilized in vehicles, aircraft, factories, and diverse cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Recent research reveals that conventional security models (CRAM) are outdated, and an Enhanced Remote Attacker Model (ERAM) with expanded capabilities is emerging. ERACAN is introduced as the first comprehensive defense system against ERAM, offering detection, classification, and optional prevention. It employs a dedicated monitor node with an FPGA controller for link-layer surveillance and smart physical-layer feature checks. Evaluations on a testbed and real vehicle demonstrate 100% detection for CRAM attacks and 99.7-100% for ERAM attacks with low latency.",

    "conclusion": "ERACAN effectively defends against ERAM threats with high detection rates (100% for CRAM, 99.7-100% for ERAM), real-time operation, and attack classification. It addresses critical gaps in CAN security through novel delegation to FPGA and adaptive feature modeling.",
