    "abstract": "Compared to traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC), cooperative ACC (CACC) can improve the response sensitivity of the following vehicles by using additional information, e.g., the acceleration of preceding vehicles, transmitted via inter-vehicle wireless communications. However, communication delays degrade string stability. This study proposes a deep learning method using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict preceding vehicle acceleration using onboard radar data. Simulations with NGSIM data showed LSTM prediction accuracy (R²=0.766) and demonstrated that LSTM control maintains string stability when communication delay exceeds 0.115s.",

    "conclusion": "LSTM prediction effectively compensates communication delays in CACC systems, maintaining string stability beyond 0.115s delay. The method provides an alternative information source when wireless communication degrades.",
