    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a key tool in Scientific Machine Learning since their introduction in 2017, enabling the efficient solution of ordinary and partial differential equations using sparse measurements. Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the training and optimization of PINNs, covering aspects such as network architectures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition, and the use of adaptive weights and activation functions. A notable recent development is the Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANS), which leverage a representation model originally proposed by Kolmogorov in 1957, offering a promising alternative to traditional PINNs. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in PINNs, focusing on improvements in network design, feature expansion, optimization techniques, uncertainty quantification, and theoretical insights. We also survey key applications across a range of fields, including biomedicine, fluid and solid mechanics, geophysics, dynamical systems, heat transfer, chemical engineering, and beyond. Finally, we review computational frameworks and software tools developed by both academia and industry to support PINN research and applications.",
    "methodology": "Review and synthesis of algorithmic developments in Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML), including modifications to representation models (MLPs, KANs), governing equation reformulations, and optimization techniques (adaptive weighting, domain decomposition). Focuses on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving forward/inverse problems in differential equations.",
    "conclusion": "PINNs and PIKANs provide powerful frameworks for integrating physical laws with data-driven methods, enabling efficient solutions to differential equations in scenarios with incomplete knowledge and sparse measurements. Key advancements include novel network architectures, adaptive optimization, and uncertainty quantification, with broad applications across scientific domains. Future work should address scalability, high-dimensional problems, and theoretical guarantees.",
