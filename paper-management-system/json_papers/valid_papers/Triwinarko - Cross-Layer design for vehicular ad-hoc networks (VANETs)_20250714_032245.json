    "abstract": "Vehicular communication, or vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), is a wireless vehicular networking technology that can support the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Nowadays, ITS is not only discussing about connected cars on the road but also a fully automated smart vehicle as well. Many emerging vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications such as collision warning, traffic management, platooning, remote vehicle control, cooperative driving, and autonomous driving are already in the implementation or development phase. The new task group IEEE 802.11bd (TGbd) was recently formed to explore the future roadmap for V2X and is working toward a new standard called next-generation V2X (NGV). NGV is expected to target larger future applications that require higher throughput, operate in a higher mobility environment, and have extended communication range. Cross-Layer design is an emerging solution that supports new NGV applications. Thus, in this thesis, we propose a new cross-layer PHY MAC NET architecture to improve the performance of NGV applications. We begin this research by identifying enhancements to the PHY and MAC layers of other IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standards that could be adopted for the 802.11bd standard. Next, we propose our first contribution using a multi-layered design at the PHY MAC NET layers to improve the performance of NGV applications in a higher mobility environment. The simulation results show that our proposed cross-layer solution could achieve twice the throughput improvement at MAC layer level and also could work in environment with relative speed between vehicles of up to 500 km/h, as requested by the NGV standard. However, the throughput performance decreased in dense VANETs due to the blocking problem in the MAC layer. We propose our second contribution to solve this problem by using a cross-layer design based on the selection of transmitting antennas and the adaptation of the transmitted power. The simulation results show that the proposed cross-layer design allows more vehicles to communicate simultaneously and significantly improves the average network throughput, especially for high density VANETs.",
