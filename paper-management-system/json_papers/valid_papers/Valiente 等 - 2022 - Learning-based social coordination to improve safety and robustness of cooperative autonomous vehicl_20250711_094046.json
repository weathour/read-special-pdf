    "abstract": "It is expected that autonomous vehicles (AVs) and heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HVs) will coexist on the same road. The safety and reliability of AVs will depend on their social awareness and their ability to engage in complex social interactions in a socially accepted manner. However, AVs are still inefficient in terms of cooperating with HVs and struggle to understand and adapt to human behavior, which is particularly challenging in mixed autonomy. To address these challenges, we frame the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose an approach that allows AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, account for all vehicles' interests, and safely adapt to other traffic situations. We quantify AVs' social preferences and propose a distributed reward structure that introduces altruism into their decision-making process, allowing altruistic AVs to learn to establish coalitions and influence the behavior of HVs.",
    "methodology": "Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with a distributed reward structure incorporating Social Value Orientation (SVO) angles. Utilizes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network for temporal feature extraction from VelocityMap observations, combined with a safety prioritizer algorithm that masks high-risk actions using time-to-collision metrics.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed MARL framework enables AVs to learn cooperative policies robust to diverse human behaviors and traffic scenarios. Altruistic AVs improve traffic safety and efficiency by coordinating with each other and influencing human-driven vehicles without explicit behavior modeling. Higher traffic aggressiveness increases the importance of social coordination for optimal outcomes.",
