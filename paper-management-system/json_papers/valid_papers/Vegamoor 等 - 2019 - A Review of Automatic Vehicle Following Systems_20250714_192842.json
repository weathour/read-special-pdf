    "abstract": "There has been considerable interest recently in the development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Automatic vehicle following capability is central for CAVs; in this article, we provide a review of the critical issues in the longitudinal control design for automatic vehicle following systems (AVFS) employed by CAVs. This expository review differs from others in providing a review of underlying methodologies for design of AVFS and the impact of AVFS on traffic mobility and safety.",
    "methodology": "The paper reviews various methodologies for designing AVFS, including vehicle models, string stability in nominal maneuvers, information flow and its relation to string stability, traffic flow modeling with CAVs, and traffic safety in emergency braking maneuvers.",
    "conclusion": "The review highlights the importance of connectivity in enhancing traffic safety and mobility, the challenges in modeling and control of AVFS, and the need for further research in heterogeneous traffic scenarios and mixed traffic conditions.",
