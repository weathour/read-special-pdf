    "abstract": "The issue of organizing efficient interaction between V2X system elements has become increasingly critical in recent years. Utilizing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology enables achieving the necessary balance of safety, reducing system load, and ensuring a high degree of vehicle automation. This study aims to develop a simulation system for V2X applications in various element placement configurations and conduct a numerical analysis of several V2X system interaction schemes. The research analyzes various methods, including clustering, edge computing, and fog computing, aimed at minimizing system losses. The results demonstrate that each proposed model can be effectively implemented on mobile nodes. Results also provide insights into the average expected request processing times, thereby enhancing V2X system organization. The authors propose a comprehensive model that enables the distribution and prediction of system parameters and resources for diverse computational tasks, essential for the successful implementation and utilization of V2X technology.",
    "methodology": "Mathematical modeling of V2X interactions, simulation system development using Godot Engine and GDScript with OpenStreetMap data integration, comparative analysis of three scenarios: OBU-RSU-MEC-Cloud model, floating mRSUs, and on-call mRSUs with Hungarian and greedy algorithms.",
    "conclusion": "The simulation system demonstrates that direct RSU-MEC connections minimize data loss but are costly. Clustering offers cost-effective alternatives with higher losses. mRSUs improve efficiency at higher speeds, though gains are limited under uniform RSU coverage. System stabilization occurs within 100 seconds, enabling reduced simulation times.",
