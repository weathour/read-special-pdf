    "abstract": "The issue of organizing efficient interaction between vehicle-to-everything (V2X) system elements has become increasingly critical in recent years. Utilizing V2X technology enables achieving the necessary balance of safety, reducing system load, and ensuring a high degree of vehicle automation. This study aims to develop a simulation system for V2X applications in various element placement configurations and conduct a numerical analysis of several V2X system interaction schemes. The research analyzes various methods, including clustering, edge computing, and fog computing, aimed at minimizing system losses. The results demonstrate that each proposed model can be effectively implemented on mobile nodes. The results also provide insights into the average expected request processing times, thereby enhancing the organization of the V2X system. The authors propose a model that enables the distribution of system parameters and resources for diverse computational tasks, which is essential for the successful implementation and utilization of V2X technology.",
    "methodology": "Mathematical modeling of OBU-RSU interaction, simulation system development using Godot Engine and GDScript, numerical experiments comparing path loss models (Hata and 3GPP Urban Canyon), and evaluation of three mRSU deployment scenarios (no mRSU, floating mRSU, on-call mRSU) under clustered and direct RSU-EC configurations.",
    "conclusion": "Direct RSU-EC connections minimize data loss but are costly; clustering offers a cost-effective alternative. mRSUs reduce losses (especially in on-call deployment), though gains are limited under uniform RSU coverage. The custom simulation system achieves stability within 100s and outperforms existing tools in resource efficiency. Future work includes scaling the model and assessing energy efficiency.",
