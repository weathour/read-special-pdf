    "abstract": "Intelligent Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems(ICVIS) need to conduct automated vehicle tests in real driving scenarios, but due to safety and other issues, there are not enough conditions for researchers to perform in fully realistic scenarios. As an alternative to the real-world ICVIS, digital replicas of real roads, communications, and traffic can be created and tested in a mixed reality simulation environment. The mixed reality ICVIS simulation platform can be the first step to verify the functional performance and safety of the ICVIS, so as to facilitate the final implementation on physical vehicles. By using the mixed reality environment, people can create a variety of environments at low cost, including traffic, obstacles, and unexpected situations. In this study, a mixed reality simulation platform for ICVIS was developed using the Unity game engine, and a mixed reality simulation architecture was proposed, which divided the transition process from virtual to real into three levels. The first level is the tools for providing digital replicas of real road conditions, communication conditions, and traffic conditions (including roadrunner, OMNET , SUMO, and python). The second level is the Unity engine that uses the data provided by the first level to build simulation objects and simulation platforms. The third level is the driving simulator that provides a first-person driving experience in the microscopic ICVIS simulation. A simulation evaluation platform that allows users to experience the mixed reality ICVIS in the cockpit from a first-person perspective was built. The simulation results show that the platform is an effective tool for virtual traffic simulation and mixed reality scene reproduction of the ICVIS, which saves the simulation test cost of traffic strategies, improves the evaluation experience, and provides a new simulation evaluation method for the ICVIS.",
    "methodology": "Developed a mixed reality simulation platform using Unity game engine, with a three-level architecture: Level 1 uses tools like RoadRunner, OMNET++, SUMO, and Python for digital replicas of roads, communications, and traffic; Level 2 employs Unity to build simulation objects; Level 3 integrates a driving simulator for first-person experience. Traffic flow is simulated via SUMO, 3D models are created with RoadRunner, V2V/V2I communications are handled by OMNET++, and Unity provides visualization and user interface.",
    "conclusion": "The platform is effective for virtual traffic simulation and mixed reality scene reproduction, saving simulation test costs, improving evaluation experience, and providing a new method for ICVIS. However, it faces challenges like frame rate drops in large-scale scenes and incomplete representation of real-world factors, with future optimizations needed for better performance and realism.",
