    "abstract": "Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM) are important for safety performance evaluation, since crashes are rare events and historical crash data does not capture near crashes that are also critical for improving safety. This paper focuses on SSM and their applications, particularly in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) safety modeling. It aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of significant SSM studies, identify limitations and opportunities for future SSM and CAV research, and assist researchers and practitioners with choosing the most appropriate SSM for safety studies.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and critical analysis of SSM classifications (time-based, deceleration-based, energy-based), simulation-based safety evaluation, and trajectory optimization methods for CAV.",
    "conclusion": "SSM are vital for CAV safety evaluation due to rare crash events. Key challenges include SSM validity in mixed autonomy traffic, threshold sensitivity, and need for CAV-specific SSM. Future research should focus on universal SSM frameworks, new data sources (connected vehicle data), and high-dimensional safety metrics like MPrISM.",

      "Methodology": [
        "Categorizes SSM into time-based (e.g., TTC, PET), deceleration-based (e.g., DRAC), and energy-based (e.g., Delta-V) metrics; reviews simulation tools (VISSIM, SSAM) for CAV safety evaluation.",

        "Data from literature (no primary collection); includes field observations (video/LiDAR), connected vehicle datasets (SPMD), and simulation outputs. Representativeness varies by data source fidelity.",
        "No original experiments; synthesizes validation studies. Evaluation adequacy relies on cited calibration efforts (e.g., EVT models), but thresholds remain subjective.",
