    "abstract": "This paper studies the intra-platoon message delivery delay for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) moving on a highway. A theoretical model analyzes the impact of system parameters like platoon size, intra-platoon spacing, and non-platoon vehicle density on delay. The model considers V2V hop-by-hop communication, channel access contention from platoon/non-platoon vehicles, and hidden node effects. Validation via simulations shows the model's accuracy, and it provides guidelines for parameter settings to maintain platoon stability.",
    "methodology": "Derived an analytical model for mean intra-platoon message delivery delay using IEEE 802.11 CSMA/CA channel access mechanisms. The model incorporates vehicle spatial distributions (Poisson for non-platoon, equidistant for platoon), contention domains, hidden nodes, and Bianchi's saturation model for channel access probability. Validated through NS-2.35 simulations and Matlab numerical analysis.",
    "conclusion": "The analytical model accurately quantifies delay dependencies on key parameters (spacing, platoon size, non-platoon density). Larger spacing, platoon size, non-platoon density, or contention range increase delay, while higher transmission rates reduce it. The model enables optimal parameter tuning for platoon stability.",

      "Overview": "The paper analyzes communication delays in vehicle platoons for autonomous driving. It develops a theoretical model to quantify message delivery delays from the leading to the last vehicle, considering highway scenarios with mixed platoon and non-platoon traffic.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Autonomous driving requires reliable low-latency communication; platoons enhance traffic efficiency but depend on timely message delivery for stability.",
        "Existing work inadequately addresses impacts of non-platoon vehicles and hidden nodes on intra-platoon delays.",
        "Delays directly affect safety-critical maneuvers; unmodeled contention from external vehicles risks destabilization.",
        "Intra-platoon delay is a microcosm of broader V2V challenges in heterogeneous traffic, crucial for collision avoidance.",
        "Contributes to vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), wireless communications, and intelligent transportation systems."

        "Provides a novel analytical framework integrating non-platoon vehicles and hidden nodes—factors omitted in prior art."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Theoretical delay model decomposes delay into channel access (using Bianchi's Markov chain) and transmission components. Validated via NS-2.35 simulations with VanetMobiSim traces.",
        "Model novelty lies in incorporating non-platoon contention and hidden nodes. Applicability is demonstrated for highway V2V; saturation assumption may overestimate non-congested scenarios.",
        "Non-platoon vehicles generated via Poisson process; platoon vehicles equidistant. Data represents typical highway traffic; message sizes align with 3GPP V2X standards (50-1200 bytes).",
        "Rigorous validation across parameter variations (spacing, density). Metrics include mean delay and neighbor/hidden node counts; captures worst-case saturation.",
        "Rooted in stochastic network theory; Bianchi's model shapes contention perspective but limits non-saturated scenarios."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Delay increases with larger spacing, platoon size, non-platoon density, or contention range; decreases with higher transmission rates. Model closely matches simulations (e.g., ±5% error in delay vs. spacing).",
        "Results are reliable (validated across parameters) and stable (consistent trends). Hidden nodes contribute significantly to delay at larger spacings."
