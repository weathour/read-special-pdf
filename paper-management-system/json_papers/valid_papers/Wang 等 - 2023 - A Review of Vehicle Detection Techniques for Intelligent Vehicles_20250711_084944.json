    "abstract": "Robust and efficient vehicle detection is an important task of environment perception of intelligent vehicles, which directly affects behavior decision-making and motion planning. This article presents a comprehensive review of vehicle detection approaches focusing on sensor types (machine vision, millimeter-wave radar, lidar, multisensor fusion) and algorithm classification. It summarizes over 300 research contributions, compares algorithm performance, analyzes application scenarios, systematically reviews adverse weather methods, and discusses challenges and future trends.",
    "methodology": "The review categorizes vehicle detection based on sensor type: 1) Machine vision (prior knowledge, machine learning, deep learning including target-level detection and semantic segmentation); 2) Millimeter-wave radar (target-level and image-level); 3) Lidar (traditional methods, deep learning-based 3D detection, point cloud segmentation); 4) Multisensor fusion (stereo vision, radar-camera, lidar-camera, infrared fusion). Performance comparisons and applicability scenarios are analyzed for each category.",
    "conclusion": "Multisensor fusion is essential for robust vehicle detection, especially in adverse weather. Key challenges include balancing speed-accuracy tradeoffs in deep learning models, handling complex environments (low illumination, rain, fog), and developing efficient fusion architectures. Future research should focus on lightweight networks, context-aware multitask learning, weakly supervised methods, and advanced sensors like SPAD cameras.",

      "Overview": "This paper comprehensively reviews vehicle detection techniques for intelligent vehicles, covering sensor technologies (vision, radar, lidar), algorithmic approaches (traditional methods, machine learning, deep learning), multisensor fusion strategies, and adverse weather solutions. It analyzes over 300 studies to compare performance and applicability.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Intelligent vehicles require accurate environment perception to prevent traffic accidents and enable autonomous navigation. Vehicle detection is critical but challenged by varying environments, sensor limitations, and real-time processing demands.",
        "Existing reviews lack coverage of recent advancements across all sensor types and adverse weather conditions. This paper addresses this gap by systematically categorizing and comparing state-of-the-art methods.",
        "The authors emphasize the urgency through traffic accident statistics linked to adverse weather and sensor failures, establishing vehicle detection as foundational for safe autonomous driving systems.",
        "The problem connects to broader challenges in reliable environment perception under uncertainty. Its significance lies in enabling safer autonomous transportation and advancing sensor/algorithm integration.",

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: 1) Sensor-specific processing (e.g., point cloud voxelization for lidar, ROI generation for vision); 2) Multisensor fusion levels (data, feature, decision, two-step); 3) Adverse weather adaptation (denoising, data augmentation, model improvement).",
        "Logical relationships: Sensor data informs feature extraction; features feed detection algorithms; multisensor fusion combines complementary data; adverse weather techniques enhance robustness. Deep learning automates feature extraction but requires computational optimization.",
        "Key assumptions: Sensors provide complementary strengths; deep learning can generalize across conditions; computational constraints are manageable through efficient architectures.",
        "Makes an integrative contribution: Synthesizes fragmented knowledge into a structured taxonomy, identifies performance trade-offs, and defines future research trajectories for the field."

      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods include: Traditional feature engineering (Haar, HOG), deep learning (CNNs, FCNs, PointNet), clustering (DBSCAN), and fusion techniques (Kalman filters, Bayesian fusion). Novelty lies in sensor-specific adaptations (e.g., VoxelNet for lidar, radar-image pseudo-features).",
        "Methodology is rational (leverages sensor strengths) and applicable to real-time systems, though computational demands vary. Deep learning shows high adaptability but requires optimization.",
        "Uses public datasets (KITTI, Cityscapes) and simulated data. Data preprocessing includes point cloud voxelization, image enhancement, noise filtering. Representativeness is high for standard conditions but limited for rare events.",
        "Experimental rigor is established through quantitative metrics (mAP, IoU, FPS). Evaluation covers accuracy, speed, and robustness, though comparative baselines could be broader.",

      "Results": [
        "Key results: Deep learning (YOLO, SSD) achieves high accuracy/speed trade-offs in vision; lidar-based methods excel in precision but are computationally heavy; radar provides reliable motion data but lacks detail; multisensor fusion improves robustness, especially in adverse weather.",
        "Results are significant for real-time systems (e.g., YOLO variants at >60 FPS). Reliability is validated through benchmark comparisons, but stability under sensor degradation needs further study."
