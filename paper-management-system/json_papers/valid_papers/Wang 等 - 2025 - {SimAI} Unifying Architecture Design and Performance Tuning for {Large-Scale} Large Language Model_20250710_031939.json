It addresses challenges in workload generation, computation simulation, and communication modeling by integrating training frameworks (Megatron/DeepSpeed), kernel computation libraries, and NCCL collective communication. Through multi-thread acceleration and lock-free global context-sharing, SimAI achieves 98.1% alignment with real-world results across diverse scenarios, enabling efficient infrastructure design and parameter optimization for production LLM training.",
