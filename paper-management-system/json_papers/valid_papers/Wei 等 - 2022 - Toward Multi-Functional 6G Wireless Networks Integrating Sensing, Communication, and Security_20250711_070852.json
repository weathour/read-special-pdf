    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a candidate 6G technology, aiming to unify the two key operations of the future network in a spectrum energy cost-efficient way. ISAC systems communicate and sense for targets using a common waveform, a common hardware platform, and ultimately the same network infrastructure. Nevertheless, the inclusion of information signaling in the probing waveform for target sensing raises challenges from the perspective of information security. At the same time, the sensing capability incorporated in ISAC transmission offers unique opportunities to design secure ISAC techniques. This overview article discusses these unique challenges and opportunities for the next generation of ISAC networks. We first briefly discuss the fundamentals of waveform design for sensing and communication. Then we detail the challenges and contradictory objectives involved in securing ISAC transmission, along with state-of-the-art approaches to ensure security. We then identify the new opportunity of using the sensing capability to obtain knowledge target information as an enabling approach against the known weaknesses of PHY security. Finally, we illustrate some low-cost secure ISAC architectures, followed by a series of open research topics. This family of sensing-aided secure ISAC techniques brings new insight on providing information security, with an eye on robust and hardware-constrained designs tailored for low-cost ISAC devices.",
