    "abstract": "The UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) Traffic Management (UTM) System Concept of Operations (ConOps) is the first formal design reference document of the UTM system, ConOps aims to bring Class G Airspace into government regulation. However, it should be noted that there are still some shortcomings in ConOps that require further discussion. For example, there are concerns about operational rights, privacy rights, and the potential interference caused by high-rise buildings in urban core areas. The Lane-based UTM systems could potentially help in solving the above issues. The flight paths of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in urban areas or other areas will interact with the road network, which can facilitate airspace traffic development. Ground traffic flow simulation is generally conducted on three levels: macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic. Some of the commonly used car traffic flow simulation tools include Vissim, SUMO, and MATSim. However, UAV traffic simulation is mostly at a single level, and all of the current mainstream simulation software for UAV, such as Gazebo, AirSim, and Flight Gear, are microscopic-level analyses of UAV operations, lacking uniform management of drone traffic flow and operations. In addition, these UAV traffic simulation studies do not consider the city traffic and road network. In this context, a lane-based co-simulation UAV traffic simulation method is proposed in this study.",
    "methodology": "The core methodology involves a co-simulation framework integrating SUMO for 2D ground traffic simulation and AirSim for 3D UAV operation simulation, using Unreal Engine for a high-fidelity digital environment. Communication is established via TCP protocol with coordinate conversion between SUMO's Cartesian system and AirSim's NED system. The framework includes standardized architecture for interoperability, compatibility, and synchronization, leveraging road networks to simplify 3D path planning into 2D.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed co-simulation methodology supports the development of an accurate, efficient, and scalable digital twin for autonomous UAS operations. Experimental results confirm the framework's feasibility for lane-based UTM concepts, showing high trajectory overlap between SUMO and AirSim. This integration reduces computational load, improves system efficiency, and is the first co-simulation of SUMO and AirSim, offering value for Advanced Air Mobility testing and development.",
