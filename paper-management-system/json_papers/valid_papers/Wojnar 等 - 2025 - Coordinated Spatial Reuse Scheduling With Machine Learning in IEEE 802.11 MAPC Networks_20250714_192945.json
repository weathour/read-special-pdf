    "abstract": "The densification of Wi-Fi deployments means that fully distributed random channel access is no longer sufficient for high and predictable performance. Therefore, the upcoming IEEE 802.11bn amendment introduces multi-access point coordination (MAPC) methods. This paper addresses a variant of MAPC called coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR), where devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel, with the power adjusted to minimize interference. The C-SR scheduling problem is selecting which devices transmit concurrently and with what settings. We provide a theoretical upper bound model, optimized for either throughput or fairness, which finds the best possible transmission schedule using mixed-integer linear programming. Then, a practical, probing-based approach is proposed which uses multi-armed bandits (MABs), a type of reinforcement learning, to solve the C-SR scheduling problem. We validate both classical (flat) MAB and hierarchical MAB (H-MAB) schemes with simulations and in a testbed. Using H-MABs for C-SR improves aggregate throughput over legacy IEEE 802.11 (on average by 80% in random scenarios), without reducing the number of transmission opportunities per station. Finally, our framework is lightweight and ready for implementation in Wi-Fi devices.",
    "methodology": "The paper proposes a theoretical upper bound model using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for C-SR scheduling, optimized for throughput or fairness. Additionally, it introduces a practical probing-based approach using multi-armed bandits (MABs) for reinforcement learning to solve the C-SR scheduling problem.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed H-MAB framework significantly improves network performance over existing channel access schemes (DCF, SR), achieving high throughput while preserving the minimum number of transmission opportunities per station. The framework is lightweight, simple to implement, and validated in both simulations and experimental settings.",
