    "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising technology to support real-time vehicular applications, where vehicles offload intensive computation tasks to the nearby VEC server for processing. However, the traditional VEC that relies on single communication technology cannot well meet the communication requirement for task offloading, thus the heterogeneous VEC integrating the advantages of dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), millimeter-wave (mmWave) and cellular-based vehicle to infrastructure (C-V2I) is introduced to enhance the communication capacity. The communication resource allocation and computation resource allocation may significantly impact on the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) performance and the VEC system utility. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous VEC with multiple communication technologies and various types of tasks, and propose an effective resource allocation policy to minimize the system utility while satisfying the URLLC requirement. We first formulate an optimization problem to minimize the system utility under the URLLC constraint which is modeled by the moment generating function (MGF)-based stochastic network calculus (SNC), then we present a Lyapunov-guided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to convert and solve the optimization problem. Extensive simulation experiments illustrate that the proposed resource allocation approach is effective.",
    "methodology": "Lyapunov optimization combined with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Uses Moment Generating Function (MGF)-based Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to model URLLC constraints and formulates a system utility minimization problem under reliability and latency requirements.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed Lyapunov-guided DRL resource allocation policy effectively minimizes system utility (communication fees and CPU energy consumption) while guaranteeing URLLC requirements in heterogeneous VEC. Simulations confirm superiority over baseline methods (HGRA, HGGA, EAEO, PSO, Greedy) in latency compliance, queue stability, and computational efficiency.",

        "Single-technology VEC (DSRC, C-V2I, or mmWave) fails to meet URLLC requirements due to inherent limitations: DSRC underperforms in high density, C-V2I lacks high data rates, and mmWave suffers from propagation loss/obstructions.",
        "Heterogeneous VEC integrates multiple technologies to enhance capacity but requires efficient resource allocation to balance URLLC (latency ≤ 30 ms, reliability via queue stability) and system utility (communication fees + CPU energy costs).",
