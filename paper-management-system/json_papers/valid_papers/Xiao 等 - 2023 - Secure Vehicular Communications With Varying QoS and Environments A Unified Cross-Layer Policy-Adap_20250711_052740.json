    "abstract": "With the ubiquitous connectivity in internet of vehicles, secure transmission is of vital importance for intelligent vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. However, to effectively guarantee secrecy performance, existing cryptography or physical-layer security (PLS) techniques weaken throughput when short-term channel quality statistics are low, frequently occurring due to high vehicle mobility. To improve secure data transmission throughput, we propose statistical security, leveraging time-sensitive information characteristics like vehicle positions. Time-sensitive information has an outdated rate; if the information leakage rate is below this outdated rate, eavesdroppers gain no useful information. We model the eavesdropping process using a queue system, where queue-length violation probability indicates secure transmission levels. Under this model, we investigate throughput maximization and derive an optimal power allocation scheme for legitimate vehicular users. Furthermore, as security QoS requirements and wireless environments vary in V2X communications, we propose a unified cross-layer policy-adaptation approach to guarantee varying security QoS while improving throughput. Simulation results confirm our approach significantly outperforms baseline schemes.",
    "methodology": "Proposed statistical security using a queuing model to characterize eavesdropping; formulated throughput maximization under statistical security constraints; derived optimal power allocation via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and effective bandwidth analysis; developed a cross-layer policy-adaptation framework with top-down and bottom-up optimizers for strategy switching; validated performance through simulations comparing with water-filling, secure water-filling, and statistical security schemes.",
    "conclusion": "A unified cross-layer policy-adaptation approach enhances secure V2X communications by leveraging statistical security to improve throughput while adapting to varying QoS and environments. Simulations show significant throughput gains over existing schemes, balancing security and efficiency by exploiting time-sensitive information outdated rates.",
