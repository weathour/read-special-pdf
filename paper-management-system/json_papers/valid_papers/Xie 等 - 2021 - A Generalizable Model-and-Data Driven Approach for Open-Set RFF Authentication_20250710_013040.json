    "abstract": "Radio-frequency fingerprints (RFFs) are promising solutions for realizing low-cost physical layer authentication. Machine learning-based methods have been proposed for RFF extraction and discrimination. However, most existing methods are designed for the closed-set scenario where the set of devices remains unchanged. These methods cannot be generalized to the RFF discrimination of unknown devices. To enable the discrimination of RFF from both known and unknown devices, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning framework for extracting RFFs from raw received signals. The proposed framework comprises a novel preprocessing module, called neural synchronization (NS), which incorporates the data-driven learning with signal processing priors as an inductive bias from communication-model based processing. Compared to traditional carrier synchronization techniques, which are static, this module estimates offsets by two learnable deep neural networks jointly trained by the RFF extractor. Additionally, a hypersphere representation is proposed to further improve the discrimination of RFF. Theoretical analysis shows that such a data-and-model framework can better optimize the mutual information between device identity and the RFF, which naturally leads to better performance. Experimental results verify that the proposed RFF significantly outperforms purely data-driven DNN-design and existing handcrafted RFF methods in terms of both discrimination and network generalizability.",
    "methodology": "End-to-end deep learning framework with neural synchronization (NS) module and hypersphere representation. NS replaces traditional carrier synchronization with two trainable deep neural networks for frequency and phase offset estimation, preserving device-relevant information. The hypersphere representation optimizes cosine distance between features.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. It preserves device-specific information by avoiding traditional synchronization's information loss, enhances robustness to noise, and demonstrates superior generalizability to unknown devices and aged hardware.",
