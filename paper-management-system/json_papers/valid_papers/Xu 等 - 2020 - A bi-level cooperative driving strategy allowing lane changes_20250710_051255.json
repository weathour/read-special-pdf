    "abstract": "This paper studies the cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at conflict areas (e.g., non-signalized intersections and ramping regions). Due to safety concerns, most existing studies prohibit lane change since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not appropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones), vehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential collision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The right-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the upper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then resolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are represented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a very short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the shortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving). Numerical examples show that the proposed strategy leads to good traffic performance in real-time.",
    "methodology": "A bi-level planning framework: Upper-level uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with heuristic rules to optimize vehicle passing orders for critical conflict zones; lower-level employs a passing-order-to-trajectory interpretation algorithm to resolve lane change conflicts and generate trajectories using pre-designed fifth-order polynomial curves. Simulations with Poisson-distributed vehicle arrivals and point-queue models validate the approach.",
    "conclusion": "The proposed bi-level cooperative driving strategy effectively handles lane changes in conflict areas, improving traffic efficiency and reducing delays while ensuring safety. Simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over FIFO-based methods, with the approach being computationally feasible for real-time applications and extensible to various driving scenarios.",

      "Overview": "The paper proposes a bi-level cooperative driving strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to manage lane changes in conflict areas such as intersections and work zones, aiming to enhance traffic efficiency and safety by optimizing vehicle passing orders and trajectories.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Addresses broader challenges of traffic congestion, accidents, and inefficiencies in cooperative driving systems where existing studies often prohibit lane changes due to collision risks.",
        "Motivated by the necessity of lane changes in real-world scenarios like work zones, and the limitations of current methods that oversimplify or ignore lane change maneuvers, leading to suboptimal solutions.",
        "Argues for necessity and urgency by highlighting increased collision risks and computational intractability in high-traffic scenarios, emphasizing that lane changes are unavoidable in many cases for feasible collision avoidance.",

      "Conceptual_Framework_and_Innovations": [
        "Core concepts: (1) Bi-level planning—upper-level handles passing orders for critical conflict zones, lower-level resolves lane change conflicts; (2) Passing order—string-based representation of vehicle priority for right-of-way assignment; (3) Conflict zones—categorized into critical (e.g., intersections) and local (e.g., lane change areas) based on impact.",
        "Logical relationships: Passing order determines vehicle priority in critical zones, which informs trajectory planning in lower-level; conflict zone classification structures the bi-level approach, with critical zones influencing local resolutions.",
        "Key assumptions: Vehicles must change lanes in scenarios like work zones; preceding vehicles in the same lane have higher priority; lane change trajectories are pre-designed and constrained by vehicle dynamics.",
        "Contribution type: Provides a novel framework that reduces problem complexity, enabling efficient near-optimal solutions, and advances knowledge by integrating lane changes into cooperative driving, contrasting with prior work that prohibits them."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Core methods: Upper-level uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with heuristic rules to explore passing orders in tree space; lower-level applies a passing-order-to-trajectory algorithm to derive conflict-free trajectories, incorporating fifth-order polynomial curves for lane changes.",
        "Novelty and applicability: MCTS with heuristics balances exploration and exploitation for computational efficiency; trajectory interpretation allows real-time implementation. Applicable to various objectives like delay minimization and energy-saving.",
        "Data sources: Simulation-based data with vehicle arrivals modeled as Poisson processes; data characteristics include vehicle states (position, velocity) and road geometry. Preprocessing involves discretizing roads into cells for collision avoidance, evaluated as representative via point-queue models.",
        "Experimental rigor: Three experiments test parameter sensitivity, solution quality, and traffic management; design includes varying arrival rates and comparing with FIFO-based strategies. Evaluation metrics (e.g., delay, throughput) are adequate but could be extended to energy consumption.",
