      "Overview": "This review paper synthesizes state-of-the-art physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods applied to reliability and system safety. It categorizes approaches by methodology (e.g., physics-informed loss functions, hybrid architectures) and application domains (e.g., uncertainty quantification, prognostic health management), while identifying challenges and future research needs.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Growing complexity of engineering systems necessitates high-fidelity predictive models for reliability and safety. Traditional physics-based approaches suffer from computational costs and modeling simplifications, while pure machine learning models lack physical consistency and require large datasets.",
        "To develop hybrid methodologies that integrate physics-based modeling with machine learning (PIML) for improved accuracy, generalizability, and efficiency in reliability/safety applications.",
        "Authors argue that standalone approaches are insufficient for complex systems, and PIML addresses critical gaps by leveraging physical principles to enhance data-driven models, especially in data-scarce scenarios.",
        "The problem is linked to broader challenges in predictive modeling for safety-critical systems, where errors can lead to catastrophic failures. PIML's significance lies in enabling physically consistent predictions under uncertainty.",

        "1. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML): Leverages physical knowledge to improve ML effectiveness. 2. Physics-informed loss function: Penalizes violations of physical laws in ML training. 3. Physics-informed architecture: Embeds physical equations directly into model structures.",
        "Core concepts interrelate through integration strategies: Physical knowledge constrains or enhances ML models either via loss functions (regularization) or architectural designs (e.g., physics-defined neural network layers). Hybrid models combine both approaches.",
