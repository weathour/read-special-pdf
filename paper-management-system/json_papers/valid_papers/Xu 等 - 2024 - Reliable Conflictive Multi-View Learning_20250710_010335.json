    "abstract": "Multi-view learning aims to combine multiple features to achieve more comprehensive descriptions of data. Most previous works assume multiple views are strictly aligned, but real-world data may contain low-quality conflictive instances. We propose a Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning (RCML) problem requiring models to provide decisions and reliabilities for conflictive data. Our Evidential Conflictive Multi-View Learning (ECML) method learns view-specific evidence, constructs opinions with belief masses and reliabilities, and uses a conflictive opinion aggregation strategy proven to model multi-view reliability relations. Experiments on 6 datasets verify ECML's effectiveness in accuracy, reliability, and robustness.",
    "methodology": "ECML uses view-specific evidential DNNs to collect evidence (support per category), models class probabilities via Dirichlet distributions, constructs opinions (belief mass + reliability), and employs conflictive opinion aggregation via average pooling evidence fusion. A consistency loss minimizes inter-view conflicts during training.",
    "conclusion": "ECML effectively addresses RCML by providing reliable decisions for conflictive instances. Theoretical proofs show the aggregation strategy correctly models reliability relations, while experiments demonstrate superior accuracy and uncertainty awareness compared to baselines.",

      "Overview": "Proposes ECML for reliable decision-making with uncertainty estimates in multi-view learning when views contain conflicting information.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Real-world multi-view data (e.g., sensors, user reviews) often contain misaligned/conflicting views, causing standard multi-view methods to fail.",
        "Existing solutions eliminate conflictive instances rather than deciding on them, which is insufficient for applications requiring decisions on all data.",
        "Authors argue that providing decisions with reliability scores is critical for trustworthy AI systems handling imperfect data.",
        "Conflictive instances reflect broader challenges of data noise and misalignment in real applications like recommender systems.",
        "Contributes to machine learning, multi-view fusion, and uncertainty-aware deep learning."

      "Methodology": [
        "View-specific evidential DNNs collect evidence; Dirichlet distributions model probabilities; opinions fuse via evidence averaging.",
        "Novelty: Conflictive aggregation increases uncertainty during disagreements. Applicable to classification with noisy/misaligned views.",
        "Six datasets (HandWritten, CUB, etc.); conflictive test sets generated via Gaussian noise or label misalignment. Standard datasets ensure representativeness.",
        "Compared against 5 baselines; evaluated accuracy/reliability on normal/conflictive sets; uncertainty visualized under varying noise.",
        "Follows evidential deep learning (subjective logic); uses Dirichlet distributions to model second-order uncertainty."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "ECML outperforms baselines on all 6 datasets (e.g., +2.64% accuracy on HMDB). Uncertainty increases with noise intensity, and conflictive degree effectively captures view disagreements.",
        "Results are statistically significant (10 runs), reliable (theoretically proven aggregation), and stable (consistent gains across datasets and noise levels)."

      "Argumentation_and_Logic": [
        "1) Motivate RCML problem; 2) Propose ECML with theory; 3) Validate empirically.",
