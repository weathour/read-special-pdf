    "abstract": "With the rapid deployment of intelligent transportation systems in real-life applications, both dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), utilized to enable V2X communication, are undergoing extensive development to meet the quality of service (QoS) demands of advanced vehicular applications and scenarios. Compared to C-V2X, which lacks fully validated effective reliability, DSRC has undergone extensive field testing worldwide, ensuring its practicality. IEEE 802.11bd, as the next-generation V2X (NGV) standard within DSRC, is expected to greatly exceed the performance of its predecessor, 802.11p. However, existing studies mention that the ambient traffic environment will influence the performance of V2X due to the cyber-physical properties of V2X. To fully assess the advancements of NGV, this study presents a comparative analysis of IEEE 802.11bd and IEEE 802.11p, focusing on dynamic traffic conditions. Specifically, the technical advancements of the IEEE 802.11bd standard are first theoretically examined, emphasizing significant enhancements in aspects like modulation and coding schemes, coding rates, and channel coding. Subsequently, these critical technical enhancements are implemented in Veins, a simulation framework for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), encompassing large-scale dynamic traffic scenarios. The simulation results indicate that the IEEE 802.11bd standard significantly enhances the data transfer rate compared to IEEE 802.11p, achieving a stable twofold increase. Furthermore, the data transmission latency is reduced by over half compared to IEEE 802.11p, while the data transmission reliability experiences a noteworthy 20% enhancement. Notably, the enhanced data transmission mode of the IEEE 802.11bd standard requires an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, this research evaluates the data dissemination properties in the IoV and finds that the traffic volume has a limited impact on the data propagation speed.",
    "methodology": "Implemented key technical improvements (256-QAM MCS, 5/6 coding rate, LDPC coding) in the Veins simulation framework.

    "conclusion": "IEEE 802.11bd achieves approximately twice the data throughput and up to 20% higher transmission reliability than IEEE 802.11p in dynamic traffic scenarios. V2X standards and radio signal transmission power significantly improve data dissemination effectiveness, while traffic volume has limited impact on propagation distance.",
