    "abstract": "The construction of a digital twin simulation platform is crucial for the development of intelligent cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems, as it provides a foundation for simulating various cooperative vehicle-infrastructure scenarios, improving the user experience of smart traffic, and simplifying the experimental process of intelligent cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems. This paper focuses on the research of ICVIS-H (Intelligent Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems on highways) and develops a digital twin simulation platform based on software such as Unity3D, SUMO (or roadside units with corresponding detectors, such as cameras, millimeter-wave radar, etc.), V2V V2I information flow, 3D reconstruction, and driving simulator to simulate real-time traffic flow and ICVIS-H scenarios, such as gateway control, speed funnel, and speed limit in construction areas. The platform enables users to control the vehicle driving in the scene through the vehicle simulator or PC, thereby enhancing the human-computer interaction experience. The simulation results demonstrate that the platform is an effective tool for virtual traffic simulation and digital twin scene reproduction for intelligent cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems, saving testing costs for each traffic strategy, improving user experience, and providing a new simulation approach for ICVIS-H.",
    "methodology": "Developed a digital twin platform using Unity3D for 3D visualization and physics, SUMO for traffic flow simulation (or real data from roadside units), OMNeT++ for V2V/V2I communication modeling, and a driving simulator for user interaction. The approach included 3D scene reconstruction with Blender, terrain modeling using B-spline curves, and subjective/objective evaluation methods.",
    "conclusion": "The platform effectively replicates highway road topology, simulates over 1000 vehicles with a frame rate exceeding 60 fps, reduces testing costs, improves user experience, and provides a new simulation approach for ICVIS-H scenarios, though it faces limitations in optimization and realism.",
