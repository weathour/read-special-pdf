    "abstract": "Enabling technologies of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) bring new opportunities to signalized intersection control. This study proposes a hierarchical and implementation-ready cooperative driving framework with a mixed traffic composition of CAVs, connected vehicles (CVs), and regular vehicles (RVs) for urban arterials. The proposed framework combines centralized and distributed control concepts, where the infrastructure generates optimal signal timing plans and provides high-level trajectory guidance to the CAVs while detailed trajectories are generated by each vehicle. The system consists of three levels: vehicle-level state transition diagrams for CAV operations, intersection-level mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for signal and arrival time optimization, and corridor-level linear programming (LP) for offset optimization. Simulation results from a real-world arterial corridor show reduced delays (2.2-33.0%) and fuel consumption (3.9-7.4%) across different CAV penetration rates.",
    "methodology": "Hierarchical framework combining: 1) Vehicle-level state transition diagrams for CAV operations (eco-trajectory planning, CACC platooning, collision avoidance), 2) Intersection-level MILP optimizing signal timing and CAV arrival times, 3) Corridor-level LP for dynamic offset optimization using link performance functions.",
    "conclusion": "The framework reduces total delay by 2.2-33.0% and fuel consumption by 3.9-7.4% across CAV penetration rates. Benefits increase with higher CAV adoption. Dynamic offset optimization accommodates volume fluctuations, improving mobility and fuel economy. The implementation-ready design works with existing infrastructure and partial CAV deployment.",
