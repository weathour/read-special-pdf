    "abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive examination of Radio Resource Allocation (RRA) tailored specifically to the context of vehicle platooning. It presents an overview of V2X communications, vehicle platooning, and RRA standards, followed by an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art categorized by communication technologies, RRA modes, and coverage conditions. The paper identifies key research challenges and opportunities, offering guidance for future research.",
    "methodology": "Survey methodology involving comprehensive literature review, categorization of existing works based on communication technologies (D2D, LTE-V2X, NR-V2X), RRA modes (centralized/distributed), and coverage conditions. Analysis includes comparative evaluation of approaches and identification of research gaps.",
    "conclusion": "Vehicle platooning requires specialized RRA strategies distinct from generic V2X due to unique requirements like centralized management via Platoon Leaders, geographical proximity of vehicles, and need for ultra-low latency. Current standards lack platoon-specific RRA mechanisms, necessitating focused research on cooperative resource allocation, interference management, and dynamic scheduling.",
