    "abstract": "The proliferation of connected vehicles and the advent of New Radio (NR) technologies have ushered in a new era of intelligent transportation systems. Ensuring reliable and low-latency communication between vehicles and their surrounding environment is of utmost importance for the success of these systems. This paper presents a novel approach to predict Quality of Service (QoS) in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications through nested cross-validation. Our methodology employs several machine learning (ML) methods to predict some QoS metrics, such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), and throughput, in NR-based V2X scenarios. In ML employment, nested cross-validation approach, unlike conventional cross-validation approach, prevents information leakage from parameter selection into hyperparameter selection, and this results in getting more robust results in terms of overfitting. The study utilizes real-world NR-V2X datasets to train and validate the proposed ML methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately predicting QoS parameters, even in dynamic and challenging vehicular environments. In summary, our research contributes to the advancement of NR-based V2X communication systems by introducing employment of ML methods with a novel approach for QoS prediction. The combination of accurate predictions through nested cross-validation not only enhances the reliability of communication in connected vehicles landscape but also has a supportive role for stakeholders to make informed decisions for the optimization and management of vehicular networks.",
    "methodology": "The paper employs several machine learning methods (SVR, ANN, GBR, RF, LGBM, CBR) with nested cross-validation to predict QoS metrics like PDR and throughput in NR-V2X scenarios. The dataset is pre-processed to remove duplicates and missing values, and normalization is applied for ANN and SVR. Nested cross-validation is used to prevent information leakage and overfitting.",
    "conclusion": "The research demonstrates that RF, GBR, and CBR perform best in predicting QoS metrics, with RF leading in MAE metrics and CBR in RMSE metrics. The nested cross-validation approach enhances robustness and prevents overfitting, making the methodology suitable for real-time V2X applications. Future work should focus on expanding the dataset size and exploring more advanced ML methods.",
