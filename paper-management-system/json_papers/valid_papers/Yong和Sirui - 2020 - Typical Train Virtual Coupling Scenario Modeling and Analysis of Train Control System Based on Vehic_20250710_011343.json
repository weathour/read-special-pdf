    "abstract": "In a train control system based on vehicle-vehicle communication, a virtual coupling operation mode is proposed to improve the current line capacity. First, the composition, function and information interaction of the train control system and the train virtual coupling function module are analyzed. Secondly, the traditional train operation mode and train virtual coupling operation mode are compared and analyzed, and the process of train virtual coupling is proposed. Then, the typical scenario of train virtual coupling is described by SysML, and the key properties of the function, such as boundedness and reachability, are validated by modeling with colored Petri nets. In this paper, formal modeling and verification of typical scenarios in the train virtual coupling mode are carried out to ensure that the system meets safety, functionality and performance requirements, thereby reducing functional design defects, which is of great significance for functional design and safety.",

This research supports the design and implementation of train virtual coupling functions and is significant for the advancement of vehicle-vehicle communication-based train control systems.",
