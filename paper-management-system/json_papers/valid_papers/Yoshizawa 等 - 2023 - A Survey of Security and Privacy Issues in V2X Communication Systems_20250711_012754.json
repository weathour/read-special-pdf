    "abstract": "This survey examines security and privacy challenges in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication systems, focusing on inconsistencies in ETSI ITS standards and EU pilot projects. Through analysis of standards, research outputs, and real-world implementations, it identifies critical gaps in security frameworks, conducts root cause analysis of these deficiencies, and provides recommendations for improving vehicular communication security and privacy protections.",
    "methodology": "Comprehensive literature review and gap analysis of ETSI ITS specifications, EU pilot projects, and academic research. Includes root cause analysis of identified security vulnerabilities and privacy shortcomings through systematic comparison of standards and real-world implementations.",
    "conclusion": "Significant security and privacy gaps exist in current V2X standards, particularly in ETSI ITS specifications. Key issues include conflicts between privacy requirements and safety functionality, inconsistent certificate management approaches, and lack of revocation mechanisms. Recommendations include revising pseudonym management, addressing vehicle-type-specific privacy needs, and developing active certificate revocation systems.",

      "Overview": "This survey analyzes security and privacy vulnerabilities in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication systems, with focus on European standards (ETSI ITS) and pilot projects. It identifies gaps between standardization efforts and actual security requirements, providing root cause analysis and improvement recommendations.",
      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Growing deployment of V2X systems raises security concerns as vehicles become increasingly connected and controlled by electronic systems. The EU's position as a major vehicle exporter necessitates compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations.",
        "To address inconsistencies in V2X security standards and identify unreported vulnerabilities that could compromise road safety and user privacy.",
        "The authors demonstrate that current standards contain fundamental flaws that create security risks, potentially leading to accidents and privacy violations, establishing urgency through real-world attack scenarios.",
        "V2X security gaps represent a critical subset of broader intelligent transportation system vulnerabilities, where standardization failures could undermine public trust and adoption of connected vehicles.",

          "V2X Communication: Vehicle-to-Everything communication encompassing V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle), V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure), V2P (vehicle-to-pedestrian), and V2N (vehicle-to-network)",

          "Standards Gap: Discrepancies between documented security protocols (ETSI ITS) and actual implementation requirements"
        ],
        "Pseudonymity serves as the primary privacy mechanism within PKI-based authentication systems, but conflicts with safety requirements when implemented per current standards. Gaps in standardization create vulnerabilities that adversaries exploit across different communication modes.",
        "Implied assumption that privacy protection requirements apply uniformly to all vehicle types, and that certificate-based authentication can function effectively in dynamic vehicular environments without compromising safety.",
        "Identifies systemic flaws in existing standards, proposing a revised framework for security-priority alignment and contributing to the evolution of vehicular security paradigms."
      ],
      "Methodology": [
        "Systematic analysis of ETSI ITS standards, IEEE 1609.2, 3GPP specifications, and EU project documentation. Comparative assessment of US (SCMS) and EU certificate management approaches. Threat modeling based on attack typologies.",
        "Novelty lies in focusing on root causes of standardization gaps rather than technical solutions. Methodology is applicable to regulatory bodies and standards development organizations for improving specifications.",
        "Primary sources include ETSI technical specifications, EU project deliverables (5GCAR, SCOOP), and academic literature. Data represents EU-focused implementations but has global relevance for V2X security.",
        "Qualitative analysis based on document review and vulnerability mapping. Evaluation metrics include consistency checks against security principles (CIA triad) and regulatory compliance (GDPR).",
        "Follows standards-based engineering paradigm, emphasizing practical implementability over theoretical security models, which focuses the analysis on real-world constraints."
      ],
      "Results": [
        "Identified critical gaps: 1) Privacy-safety conflict in DENM messages, 2) Lack of active certificate revocation in ETSI, 3) Inconsistent pseudonym management, 4) Vehicle-type-agnostic privacy requirements, 5) Fundamental architectural differences between EU and US approaches.",
        "Results demonstrate systemic vulnerabilities with high reliability due to multi-source verification. Stability concerns arise from evolving standards and emerging C-V2X technologies."

      "Argumentation_and_Logic": [
        "Hierarchical argument: 1) Establish V2X security importance, 2) Reveal standardization gaps through comparative analysis, 3) Demonstrate consequences via threat models, 4) Propose solutions.",
        "Key steps: Standards documentation analysis → Vulnerability identification → Root cause categorization → Impact assessment → Recommendation formulation.",
        "Strengths: Comprehensive standard coverage and clear vulnerability demonstration. Weakness: EU focus limits global applicability. Authors address rebuttals by justifying EU-centric analysis based on its automotive industry dominance."
      ],
      "Strengths_and_Limitations": [
        "Comprehensive gap analysis across standards and projects; novel focus on root causes rather than symptoms; actionable recommendations for standards bodies.",
        "Methodology constrained to document analysis without real-world penetration testing; limited consideration of non-EU implementations.",
        "Standards-based approach inherently limits exploration of alternative security paradigms that might resolve identified conflicts."

      "Academic_Discourse_and_Rhetoric": [
        "Positions itself as a corrective to prior surveys by focusing on standardization root causes rather than technical solutions within specific domains.",
        "Uses regulatory terminology (GDPR compliance) and safety-critical language to establish urgency. Contrastive framing highlights EU-US standard differences.",
        "Builds authority through extensive standards citation (ETSI, IEEE) and project documentation. Strategic citations demonstrate comprehensive coverage while highlighting gaps in existing literature."
      ],
      "Conclusions_and_Implications": [
        "Current V2X standards contain fundamental security-privacy conflicts and implementation gaps requiring urgent revision. Architectural differences between regions create interoperability challenges.",
        "Future work should: 1) Develop vehicle-type-specific privacy frameworks, 2) Implement active revocation mechanisms, 3) Resolve pseudonym-safety conflicts, 4) Establish global security certification standards, 5) Investigate smartphone integration (V2P) security implications."
