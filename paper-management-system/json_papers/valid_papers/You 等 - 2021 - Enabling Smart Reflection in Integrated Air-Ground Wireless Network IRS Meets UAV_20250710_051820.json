    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have emerged as two promising technologies to boost the performance of wireless communication networks by proactively altering wireless communication channels via smart signal reflection and maneuver control, respectively. However, they face different limitations in practice, which restrain their future applications. In this article, we propose new methods to jointly apply IRS and UAV in integrated air-ground wireless networks by exploiting their complementary advantages. Specifically, the terrestrial IRS is used to enhance the UAV-ground communication performance, while the UAV-mounted IRS is employed to assist in terrestrial communication. We present their promising application scenarios, new communication design issues, as well as potential solutions. In particular, we show that it is practically beneficial to deploy both terrestrial and aerial IRSs in future wireless networks to reap the benefits of smart reflections in 3D space.",

      "Background_and_Motivation": [
        "Research background involves challenges in achieving ultra-reliable, high-capacity wireless communication for 6G due to random and time-varying channels, with broader issues including global 3D coverage, high data rates, and low latency.",
        "Motivation stems from the individual limitations of UAVs (e.g., size, weight, power constraints and channel blocking) and IRSs (e.g., fixed locations, half-space coverage), aiming to solve specific problems like enhancing UAV-ground communication with terrestrial IRS and assisting terrestrial communication with UAV-mounted IRS.",
        "Authors argue for necessity by emphasizing that existing techniques cannot alter wireless channels, and urgency is driven by emerging Internet of Everything applications requiring advanced 6G capabilities.",
