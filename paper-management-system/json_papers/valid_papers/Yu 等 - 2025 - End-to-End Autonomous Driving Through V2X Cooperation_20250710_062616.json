    "abstract": "Cooperatively utilizing both ego-vehicle and infrastructure sensor data via V2X communication has emerged as a promising approach for advanced autonomous driving. However, current research mainly focuses on improving individual modules rather than end-to-end learning to optimize planning performance. This paper introduces UniV2X, a cooperative autonomous driving framework that integrates key driving modules across diverse views into a unified network. We propose a sparse-dense hybrid data transmission and fusion mechanism for effective vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, offering effectiveness in enhancing perception, mapping, and occupancy prediction; transmission-friendliness for limited communication conditions; and reliability through interpretable data. Experiments on DAIR-V2X demonstrate significant improvements in planning and intermediate outputs.",
    "methodology": "End-to-end learning framework (UniV2X) integrating agent perception, online mapping, occupancy prediction, and planning. Uses sparse-dense hybrid transmission (instance-level queries for agents/lanes, scene-level occupied probability maps for occupancy), temporal synchronization via flow prediction, rotation-aware spatial synchronization, and cross-view data fusion.",
    "conclusion": "UniV2X significantly enhances planning performance (61% reduction in collision rate, 9.3% reduction in off-road rate vs. no fusion) and intermediate tasks while maintaining low transmission costs. The framework demonstrates reliability under data corruption and advances cooperative autonomous driving through interpretable end-to-end optimization.",
