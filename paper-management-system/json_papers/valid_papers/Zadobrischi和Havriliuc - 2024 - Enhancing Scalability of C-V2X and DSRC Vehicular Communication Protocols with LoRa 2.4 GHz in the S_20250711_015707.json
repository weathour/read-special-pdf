    "abstract": "In the realm of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicular communication technologies such as Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), and LoRa 2.4 GHz play crucial roles in enhancing road safety, reducing traffic congestion, and improving transport efficiency. This article explores the integration of these communication protocols within smart intersections, emphasizing their capabilities and synergies. DSRC, based on IEEE 802.11p, provides reliable short-range communication with data rates up to 27 Mbps and latencies below 50 ms, ideal for real-time safety applications. C-V2X leverages LTE and 5G networks, offering broader coverage up to 10 km and supporting data rates up to 100 Mbps, with latencies as low as 20 ms in direct communication mode (PC5). LoRa 2.4 GHz, known for its long-range (up to 15 km in rural areas, 1–2 km in urban settings) and low-power characteristics, offers data rates between 0.3 and 37.5 kbps, suitable for non-critical data exchange and infrastructure monitoring. The study evaluates the performance and interoperability of these technologies in urban environments, focusing on data latency, transmission reliability, and scalability. Experimental results from simulated and real-world scenarios show that DSRC maintains reliable communication within 1 km with minimal interference. C-V2X demonstrates superior scalability and coverage, maintaining robust communication over several kilometers in high-density urban settings. LoRa 2.4 GHz exhibits excellent penetration through urban obstacles, maintaining connectivity and efficient data transmission with packet error rates below 10%.",
    "methodology": "Simulation and experimental evaluation in urban environments, focusing on data latency, transmission reliability, and scalability. Methods include ray tracing modeling for signal propagation, real-world testing, and performance metrics analysis.",
    "conclusion": "The technologies are complementary: DSRC excels in latency-sensitive safety applications, C-V2X provides extensive coverage and high data rates for traffic management, and LoRa 2.4 GHz offers reliable long-range communication for infrastructure monitoring. A hybrid approach integrating all three is essential for resilient and adaptive ITS solutions, supporting future smart cities and autonomous vehicles.",
