    "abstract": "Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is a frontier in the evolution of distributed communication introduced in 3GPP release 14 to advanced use cases. While research efforts continue to optimize the accessible bandwidth for transportation ecosystem, a bottom up analysis from the application layer perspective is necessary prior to deployment, as it can expose potential issues that can emerge in a dynamic road environment. This emphasizes on assessing the network using application- oriented metrics to evaluate its capacity of providing advanced vehicular services with stringent latency and throughput require- ments. C-V2X enables advanced applications like autonomous driving and on-the-go transaction services where consecutive exchange of messages is required. For such services, the network level metrics fails to capture the edge case service quality as they express an average measure of performance. In this paper, we present an application-oriented analysis of a transaction service built on C-V2X protocol. We analyze different design choices that affects quality of service both from network-oriented and user-centric metrics and we highlight the issues regarding packet dissemination from infrastructures for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) based service applications. We also present our study on the impact of batching in disseminating acknowledgement packets (ACK) and its consequence on both the service reliability and network congestion. Our results show that time-sensitive and mission-sensitive vehicular applications should aim for a balance between achieving the mission utility in shortest duration impact on the system-wide possible, while keeping minimal stability.",
    "methodology": "The paper presents an application-oriented analysis of a transaction service built on C-V2X protocol, focusing on different design choices affecting quality of service. It includes experimental setups with varying traffic flow rates and batch sizes for ACK packets.",
    "conclusion": "The study concludes that infrastructure-based communication services should avoid static batching policies for acknowledgement packets. Instead, adaptive schemes adjusting to traffic conditions ensure quality of service. It also highlights issues with medium access for aperiodic packets and coexistence of multi-priority packets in C-V2X networks.",
