    "abstract": "The contemporary era struggles with the intricate challenge of designing complex systems characterized by intricate webs of interactions. This thesis focuses on the theory of co-design, extending from designing individual platforms like autonomous vehicles to orchestrating entire mobility systems. It establishes a monotone theory of co-design using category theory to elucidate compositionality and functorial solution schemes, providing both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for real-world applications in embodied intelligence.",
    "methodology": "Develops a monotone theory of co-design leveraging category theory; formalizes design problems as mathematical structures; employs composition operations (series, parallel, feedback); implements solution schemes through functorial mappings; validates via case studies in autonomy and mobility systems.",
    "conclusion": "Provides a robust mathematical framework for co-design enabling efficient computation of optimal solutions; demonstrates applicability across autonomy and mobility domains; establishes compositionality as fundamental for handling system complexity; opens avenues for future extensions in modeling strategic interactions.",
