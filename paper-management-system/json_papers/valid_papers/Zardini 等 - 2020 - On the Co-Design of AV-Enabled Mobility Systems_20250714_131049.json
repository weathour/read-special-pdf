    "abstract": "The design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the design of AV-enabled mobility systems are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge about the intended service of AVs would impact their design and deployment process, whilst insights about their technological development could significantly affect transportation management decisions. This calls for tools to study such a coupling and co-design AVs and AV-enabled mobility systems in terms of different objectives. In this paper, we instantiate a framework to address such co-design problems. In particular, we leverage the recently developed theory of co-design to frame and solve the problem of designing and deploying an intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand system, whereby AVs service travel demands jointly with public transit, in terms of fleet sizing, vehicle autonomy, and public transit service frequency. Our framework is modular and compositional, allowing one to describe the design problem as the interconnection of its individual components and to tackle it from a system-level perspective. To showcase our methodology, we present a real-world case study for Washington D.C., USA. Our work suggests that it is possible to create user-friendly optimization tools to systematically assess costs and benefits of interventions, and that such analytical techniques might gain a momentous role in policy-making in the future.",
    "methodology": "The paper leverages the mathematical theory of co-design to develop a modular and compositional framework for co-designing AVs and AV-enabled mobility systems. The methodology involves multi-commodity flow modeling, optimization of fleet characteristics, and public transit service frequency.",
    "conclusion": "The framework allows stakeholders to systematically assess the impact of future interventions in urban mobility systems. It provides insights into rational design strategies, highlighting the trade-offs between costs, travel time, and emissions. The case study for Washington D.C. demonstrates the framework's applicability and suggests that investments in public transit infrastructure are rational only when large budgets are available.",
