    "abstract": "Driving can occupy a large portion of daily life and often elicit negative emotional states like anger or stress, impacting road safety and human health. This article provides a comprehensive literature survey on driver emotion recognition, reviewing 63 peer-reviewed articles since 2002. It examines methodologies for measuring and recognizing emotions in automotive contexts, finding a preference for studying high-arousal negative valence states, using cardiac, electrodermal activity, and speech signals with supervised machine learning. The survey summarizes existing work, public resources, and identifies research opportunities for advancement.",
    "methodology": "Systematic literature review of 63 peer-reviewed articles from 2002-2020, analyzing methodologies for emotion representation, elicitation, annotation, signal sensing, preprocessing, and automated recognition techniques in driving contexts.",
    "conclusion": "Driver emotion recognition predominantly focuses on high-arousal negative states like anger and stress. Cardiac, electrodermal activity, and speech signals are most frequently used with supervised machine learning. Key challenges include dataset variability, real-world generalizability, and annotation reliability. Future work requires standardized datasets, multi-modal fusion, and context-aware interaction systems.",
