    "abstract": "This article presents a robust adaptive neural control algorithm for the wing-sail-assisted vehicle to track the desired waypoint-based route, where the event-triggered mechanism is with the multiport form. The main features include reduced communication burden via multiport event-triggering, sail force compensation for energy-saving propeller operation, and neural-network approximation of system uncertainties combined with robust neural damping and dynamic surface control techniques. Lyapunov analysis proves semiglobal uniform ultimate bounded stability, validated through simulations and experiments.",

    "conclusion": "The proposed algorithm achieves effective path tracking with reduced communication burden and energy consumption. Stability is proven via Lyapunov theory, with simulations and practical experiments confirming robustness against uncertainties and disturbances.",
