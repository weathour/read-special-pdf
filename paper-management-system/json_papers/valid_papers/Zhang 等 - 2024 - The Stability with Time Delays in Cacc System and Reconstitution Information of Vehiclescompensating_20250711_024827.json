    "abstract": "The communication delays have an impact on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) of vehicle platoon systems, since the preceding and following vehicle information is utilized through vehicular Ad Hoc networks. In this paper a three-order vehicle platoon system using distributed control protocols with communication delays is designed using leading and neighboring vehicle information. The sufficient necessary conditions for local stability and string stability are derived based on the Hurwitz stability criterion and the frequency domain method without time delays, in which the thresholds of the controller gains and their relationship is revealed. For the vehicle platoon systems with time delays, the upper bounds of the time delays satisfying the local stability and string stability are given based on the method of Laplace transform. Aiming to the communication delays varied, which have greatly influence on the control performance of vehicle systems, the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model is proposed to predict the acceleration of the leading vehicle to reconstitution for the communication delays, and the algorithm has higher accuracy and relevance by comparing the acceleration prediction method based on LSTM and the KF method. Based on the simulation method of compensating communication delay based on Bi-LSTM model, it is obtained that the CACC vehicle system can still maintain local stability and string stability under infinite time delay.",
