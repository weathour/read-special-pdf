    "abstract": "A major risk of using language models in practical applications is their tendency to hallucinate incorrect statements. Hallucinations are often attributed to knowledge gaps in LMs, but we show that LMs sometimes produce hallucinations that they can separately recognize as incorrect. To do this, we construct three question-answering datasets where LMs often state an incorrect answer which is followed by an explanation with at least one incorrect claim. Crucially, we find that GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA2-70B-chat can identify 67%, 87%, and 94% of these incorrect claims, respectively. We show that this phenomenon doesn't disappear under higher temperature sampling, beam search, and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting. These findings reveal that LM hallucinations can snowball: early mistakes by an LM can lead to more mistakes that otherwise would not be made.",
    "methodology": "Empirical analysis using three custom QA datasets (Primality Testing, Senator Search, Graph Connectivity) with 500 samples each. Tested GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA2-70B-chat under greedy decoding. Employed two-stage evaluation: first measured answer accuracy, then verified model's recognition of self-generated incorrect claims in isolated sessions. Explored interventions including temperature variation, beam search, and chain-of-thought prompting.",
    "conclusion": "Language models frequently produce snowballed hallucinations—incorrect claims justifying earlier errors—which they can recognize as false when presented in isolation. This phenomenon persists across decoding strategies and temperatures. Chain-of-thought prompting reduces but doesn't eliminate snowballing, especially in composite tasks requiring concurrent reasoning.",

      "Overview": "The paper investigates how language models (LMs) generate self-reinforcing hallucinations, where initial errors trigger subsequent factually incorrect justifications that models can independently recognize as false. It demonstrates this 'snowballing' phenomenon across multiple models and tasks.",
