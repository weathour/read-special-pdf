    "abstract": "Accurate and real-time traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent traffic system and is of great significance for urban traffic planning, traffic management, and traffic control. However, traffic forecasting has always been considered an open scientific issue, owing to the constraints of urban road network topological structure and the law of dynamic change with time. To capture the spatial and temporal dependences simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is combined with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data for capturing temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is employed to traffic forecasting based on the urban road network. Experiments demonstrate that our T-GCN model can obtain the spatio-temporal correlation from traffic data and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines on real-world traffic datasets. Our tensorflow implementation of the T-GCN is available at https://github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN.",
    "methodology": "The T-GCN model integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture spatial dependence from road network topology and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal dependence from dynamic traffic data changes. The model processes traffic data represented as graphs (nodes as roads, edges as connections) and uses a loss function with L2 regularization for training.",
    "conclusion": "The T-GCN model effectively captures spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data, outperforming baseline methods (e.g., HA, ARIMA, SVR, GCN, GRU) on real-world datasets. It demonstrates robustness for both short-term and long-term predictions, reducing errors by approximately 1.5-57.8%, and is applicable to other spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.",
