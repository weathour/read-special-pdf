    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known for their effective graph encoding, are extensively used across various fields. Graph self-supervised pre-training, which trains GNN encoders without manual labels to generate high-quality graph representations, has garnered widespread attention. However, due to the inherent complex characteristics in graphs, GNNs encoders pre-trained on one dataset struggle to directly adapt to others that have different node feature shapes. This typically necessitates either model rebuilding or data alignment. The former results in non-transferability as each dataset need to rebuild a new model, while the latter brings serious knowledge loss since it forces features into a uniform shape by preprocessing such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To address this challenge, we propose a new Feature-Universal Graph contrastive pre-training strategy (FUG) that naturally avoids the need for model rebuilding and data reshaping. Specifically, inspired by discussions in existing work on the relationship between contrastive Learning and PCA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and discovered that PCA s optimization objective is a special case of that in contrastive Learning. We designed an encoder with contrastive constraints to emulate PCA s generation of basis transformation matrix, which is utilized to losslessly adapt features in different datasets. Furthermore, we introduced a global uniformity constraint to replace negative sampling, reducing the time complexity from O(n2) to O(n), and by explicitly defining positive samples, FUG avoids the substantial memory requirements of data augmentation. In cross domain experiments, FUG has a performance close to the re-trained new models.",
    "methodology": "Proposes FUG strategy with three components: (1) Dimensional Encoder (DE) to learn feature distributions and generate a basis transformation matrix unifying node features; (2) Graph Encoder (GE) using GNNs to encode structure and transformed features; (3) Relative Relationship Optimization Task (LRT-FUG), an improved contrastive loss replacing negative sampling with global uniformity constraints and using neighbor nodes as positive samples. Theoretical foundation links PCA and contrastive learning, showing PCA is a special case of contrastive objectives.",
    "conclusion": "FUG achieves near-lossless unification of diverse node features without preprocessing, enabling strong cross-dataset transferability. Cross-domain experiments show FUG performs comparably to models retrained per dataset, while intra-domain tests match state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. The method reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n) and avoids data augmentation, enhancing efficiency.",
