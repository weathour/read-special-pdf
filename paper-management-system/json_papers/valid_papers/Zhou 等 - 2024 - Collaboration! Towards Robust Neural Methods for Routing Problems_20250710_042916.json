    "abstract": "Despite enjoying desirable efficiency and reduced reliance on domain expertise, existing neural methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) suffer from severe robustness issues — their performance significantly deteriorates on clean instances with crafted perturbations. To enhance robustness, we propose an ensemble-based Collaborative Neural Framework (CNF) w.r.t. the defense of neural VRP methods, which is crucial yet underexplored in the literature. Given a neural VRP method, we adversarially train multiple models in a collaborative manner to synergistically promote robustness against attacks, while boosting standard generalization on clean instances. A neural router is designed to adeptly distribute training instances among models, enhancing overall load balancing and collaborative efficacy. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and versatility of CNF in defending against various attacks across different neural VRP methods. Notably, our approach also achieves impressive out-of-distribution generalization on benchmark instances.",
    "methodology": "Ensemble-based adversarial training with a Collaborative Neural Framework (CNF), involving inner maximization for generating global/local adversarial instances and outer minimization with a neural router to distribute instances among models. The framework adversarially trains multiple models collaboratively to mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off.",
    "conclusion": "CNF concurrently enhances standard generalization on clean instances and adversarial robustness against perturbations. It mitigates the undesirable trade-off between accuracy and robustness in neural VRP methods, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VRP variants (TSP, CVRP), and demonstrates improved out-of-distribution generalization on synthetic and benchmark datasets.",
