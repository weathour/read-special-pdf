    "abstract": "This article investigates event-driven affine formation maneuver control (AFMC) of networked unmanned surface vehicles (NUSVs). A novel dynamic interleaved periodic event-triggered mechanism (DIPETM) is proposed to prevent communication competition and address random packet losses caused by unreliable network connectivity during formation maneuvers. The approach achieves position formation and attitude consensus through discrete neighboring communication while optimizing triggering frequency and counteracting packet loss effects. Numerical simulations validate the scheme's efficacy.",

    "conclusion": "The proposed DIPETM-based AFMC scheme successfully resolves communication competition and random packet loss problems while enabling arbitrary configuration transformations.
