    "abstract": "Platoon-based connected vehicles are promising solutions for next-generation mobility. This paper investigates the joint problem of car-following coordination and data transmission scheduling in MEC-enabled cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems (CVIS). A two-tier hierarchical framework is developed: (1) a fuel-efficient mobility optimization layer for platoon coordination using a leader-predecessor-follower control protocol, and (2) a reliability-oriented V2I communication layer for delay-constrained data transmission scheduling. A closed-form expression for reliability-optimal scheduling is derived, incorporating platoon mobility, channel characteristics, and application requirements. Simulations show 16.4% reduction in fuel consumption per time slot and 1.31x higher communication reliability compared to traditional methods.",
    "methodology": "Two-tier hierarchical optimization: 1) Fuel-efficient platoon coordination via discrete-time double integrator model with LPF control protocol and MPC-based optimization; 2) Reliability-driven V2I scheduling using Rayleigh fading channel model and Shannon capacity formula, solved via KKT conditions yielding closed-form solutions.",
    "conclusion": "The joint framework improves platoon fuel efficiency by 16.4% per time slot while achieving 1.31x higher communication reliability. The mobility-driven scheduling adapts transmissions to vehicle trajectories, satisfying URLLC requirements (99.999% reliability).",
