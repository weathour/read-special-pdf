    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a progressive model predictive control scheme (PMPCS) by considering the cooperative control of local planning and path tracking for intelligent vehicles. An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) based model predictive control (MPC) method is developed to solve the planning and tracking problem. With the PMPCS, the total computational burden can be reduced sharply because of the seamless connection and mutual promotion between the optimization of two layers. Besides we also propose a novel planning algorithm, which can take traffic lights and overtaking time constraint into account. Simulation results show the reliability of the proposed algorithm and the advantages of the scheme compared with general hierarchical algorithm.",
    "methodology": "Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) based Model Predictive Control (MPC) with artificial potential field (APF) for obstacle representation, pseudo-velocity planning for traffic light constraints, and cooperative double-layer optimization framework.",
    "conclusion": "The PMPCS effectively reduces computational burden while handling traffic constraints. Simulations confirm algorithm reliability and superiority over hierarchical approaches, with reduced computation time (under 0.1s total) and low tracking error (0.0272m average lateral error).",
