    "abstract": "A pillar of Industry 4.0, Simulation Optimization is a powerful tool used across several fields, enabling system evaluation under varying conditions, facilitating performance analysis, and more efficient decision-making. On the other hand, the simulations might be time-consuming, particularly when considering complex model optimization. In this sense, metamodeling has emerged as a promising technique for simulation optimization. Metamodeling aims to establish and estimate a relationship between the inputs and outputs of a simulation model, creating a simplified model used to evaluate potential solutions during the optimization process. Metamodeling approaches can be classified as metamodeling with a fixed experimental design and adaptive metamodeling. This paper presents a systematic literature review of adaptive metamodeling in simulation optimization problems. The primary contributions of this paper are the systematic collection, examination, and discussion of knowledge disseminated in this field. We aim to support upcoming research endeavors and enhance the existing literature concerning adaptive metamodeling techniques.",
    "methodology": "Systematic Literature Review (SLR) using the CIMO framework, covering databases including Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, Taylor & Francis, and Science Direct. The review involved screening 267 articles, applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, and analyzing 68 selected papers through descriptive statistics.",
    "conclusion": "The paper consolidates knowledge on adaptive metamodeling in simulation optimization (AMSO), highlighting Kriging as the dominant metamodel and Expected Improvement as the primary acquisition function. Key applications include product design and process optimization, particularly in water management. Identified gaps include limited exploration of multi-objective problems with discrete variables and robust optimization under uncertainty. Future research should explore deep learning-based metamodels and homogeneous ensemble methods.",
