    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of vehicular networking (V2X) and autonomous driving technologies, the tight coupling between communication resources and physical control objectives in cyber-physical systems (CPS) has become a central challenge in intelligent transportation research. In resource-constrained DSRC network environments, achieving bi-directional adaptation and co-optimization between vehicle platoons (physical systems) and V2V communication networks (information systems) represents a theoretical frontier for intelligent platoon cooperative control. This study systematically investigates the complex interdependencies between dynamic variations in the communication layer subject to spectrum and power limitations and CACC-based platoon control at the physical layer, elucidating the mechanisms behind the failure of traditional decoupled design methodologies. We propose and formalize a unified framework that integrates feedback control theory, information-theoretic capacity limits, and multi-objective optimization trade-offs, enabling two-way adaptation between CACC control policies and information parameters driven by communication states. The proposed mechanism empowers vehicle platoons to sense real-time channel conditions and dynamically adjust both control actions and broadcast parameters, leading to significant improvements in safety, traffic throughput, and communication reliability. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the safety risks and performance degradation associated with fixed CACC settings under congested channels, providing critical insights for the development of future standards such as 5G-V2X.",
