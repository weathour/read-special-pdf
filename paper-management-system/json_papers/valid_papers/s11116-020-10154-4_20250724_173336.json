    "abstract": "In upcoming years, the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will reshape the transport system. The transition from a regular to an autonomous transport system, however, will take place over many years and lead to a long period with a mixed driving environment where AVs and regular vehicles (RVs) operate side by side. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the utilisation of the road capacity degrades as a function of heterogeneity in congested motorways. The analysis is based on a dedicated traffic simulator, which enables the investigation of complex dynamic spillback from congestion while allowing for different degrees of heterogeneity. The representation of autonomous vehicles is based on a modified intelligent driver model (IIDM) presented by Treiber et al. (Phys Rev E 62(2):1805 1824, 2000) and Treiber and Kesting (Traffic flow dynamics, Springer, Heidelberg, 2013), while the behaviour of drivers of RVs relies on a stochastic version of the IIDM. Three main conclusions stand out. Firstly, it is shown that in an idealised environment in which AVs operate alone, a substantially improved capacity utilisation can be attained. Secondly, when drivers of RVs are mixed with AVs, capacity utilisation degrades very fast as a function of the share of RVs. Thirdly, it is shown that the improved capacity utilisation of AVs comes in the form of reduced travel time and increased throughput, with indications that travel time reductions are the most important.",
    "methodology": "The study uses a dedicated traffic simulator based on the Improved Intelligent Driver Model (IIDM) to simulate mixed traffic scenarios with varying shares of autonomous and regular vehicles. The simulation framework includes demand, car-following, overtaking, and performance indicators modules.",
    "conclusion": "The study concludes that AVs significantly improve road capacity utilization when operating alone, but this benefit degrades rapidly when mixed with regular vehicles. Dedicated AV lanes are recommended to maximize the benefits of AVs, as they can triple consumer surplus compared to mixed traffic scenarios.",
