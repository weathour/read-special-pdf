    "abstract": "To leverage the advantages of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) within mixed traffic environments, the implementation of effective driving strategies for CAVs is crucial for enhancing traffic efficiency and safety. This study introduces an Active Lane-Changing strategy with Platoon Formation (ALC-FP), specifically designed for scenarios involving the temporary closure of the inner lane on a three-lane highway. Recognizing the increased traffic capacity afforded by CAVs traveling in platoons, we hypothesize that CAVs positioned in the middle lane will proactively execute lane changes to the outer lane. This maneuver creates space for vehicles in the inner lane to change lanes concurrently, particularly when the rear vehicle in the target lane is also a CAV, thus allowing for necessary speed adjustments to facilitate the lane change. Utilizing a cellular automata (CA) model, we conducted simulation experiments to assess the efficacy of the ALC-FP strategy in comparison to the traditional Accident Warning Lane-Changing (AW-LC) strategy. The results indicate that in high-density scenarios, the ALC-FP strategy achieved a 76.36% reduction in delays and a 73.8% improvement in safety compared to the AW-LC strategy, particularly at an MPR of 0.8. These findings underscore the potential of ALC-FP to significantly enhance traffic management in mixed traffic systems.",
    "methodology": "The study employs a cellular automata (CA) model to simulate mixed traffic flow scenarios involving CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). The model incorporates car-following behaviors (Gipps model for HVs, ACC and CACC for CAVs), lane-changing rules, and platoon formation mechanisms. The ALC-FP strategy is tested against the AW-LC strategy under varying traffic densities and market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs.",
    "conclusion": "The ALC-FP strategy significantly improves traffic efficiency and safety in mixed traffic environments, especially at high CAV penetration rates. It reduces delays by 76.36% and enhances safety by 73.8% compared to traditional strategies. The study highlights the importance of CAV collaboration and proactive lane-changing in managing traffic bottlenecks.",
