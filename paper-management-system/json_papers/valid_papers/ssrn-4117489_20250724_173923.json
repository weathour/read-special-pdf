    "abstract": "This study presents an integrated simulation platform for DL optimization, namely, the connected automated vehicle dedicated lanes optimization simulator (CAV-DeLOS). The developed CAV-DeLOS is based on the cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective and can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the design parameters, operation modes, contingency plan, etc. of DL in a 'What You See Is What You Get' (Wysiwyg) style. First, we introduce the architecture and features of CAV-DeLOS, which comprises of SUMO, OMNeT++, and Unity3D. We implemented all experimental scripts for DL optimization in SUMO, including the configuration of the DLs, car-following models, lane-changing models, vehicle departure models, origin-destination demands, and 2D visualization of traffic and flow simulation. We used OMNeT++ for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Unity3D is a 3D visualization platform for simulations synchronized with SUMO. Connected with the driving simulator and paired with a virtual reality (VR) helmet, Unity3D can offer a high-fidelity immersive environment for all types of users. We developed a specific communication protocol to achieve data sharing and synchronization of all components of the CAV-DeLOS. Second, this paper depicts the functions of components of CAV-DeLOS in detail, including the modeling of road networks, vehicles, traffic flow, optimal design, and evaluation indicators of DL. Finally, by using the developed CAV-DeLOS, we demonstrated and analyzed three cases: (1) without DL vs. with DL, (2) inner lane vs. outer lane, and (3) without V2I vs. with V2I. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of the developed CAV-DeLOS, and yield some interesting findings, such as (1) market penetration rates (MPRs) are an important factor in deciding whether to deploy DLs, (2) the number of lane changes when the vehicle enters leaves the designated lane is the key criterion for determining the placement of the DLs, and (3) the cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system can offer AVs CAVs with better over-the-horizon perception capabilities, helping to improve the smoothness of traffic flow in the case of abnormal events.",
    "methodology": "The study integrates SUMO, OMNeT++, and Unity3D to create a comprehensive simulation platform (CAV-DeLOS) for evaluating dedicated lanes (DLs) for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). The platform uses a cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective, combining traffic simulation (SUMO), communication network simulation (OMNeT++), and 3D visualization (Unity3D). Data synchronization is achieved through the Traffic Control Interface (TraCI), and the platform supports X-in-the-loop testing methods.",
    "conclusion": "The developed CAV-DeLOS provides a new tool for the optimal design and evaluation of DLs for CAVs. Key findings include: (1) Market penetration rates (MPRs) are crucial in deciding whether to deploy DLs, (2) the number of lane changes when entering or leaving the designated lane is a key criterion for DL placement, and (3) the cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system enhances traffic flow smoothness during abnormal events. The platform is validated through three case studies, demonstrating its feasibility and functionality.",
