    "abstract": "Dedicated Lanes (DLs) have been proposed as a potential scenario for the deployment of Automated and/or Connected Vehicles (C/AVs) on the road network. However, evidence-based knowledge regarding the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency is limited. In order to develop an adequate design for DLs, first, a conceptual framework describing the relations and interrelations between these factors and traffic safety and efficiency is needed. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework accounting for the factors that could affect the safety and efficiency of DLs. This conceptual framework is underpinned based on relevant literature on how the deployment of C/AVs, driver behaviour, and DL design and operation affect traffic safety and efficiency. Based on the conceptual framework, the knowledge gaps on DL design for C/AVs were identified and a research agenda, including prioritization of the research needs, is proposed.",
    "methodology": "The paper develops a conceptual framework based on a literature review of 83 scientific articles. The framework is underpinned by studies on dedicated lane design configurations, driver behaviour, and their implications on traffic safety and efficiency. The methodology includes an initial search in Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) databases, followed by backward and forward snowballing techniques to select further literature.",
    "conclusion": "The paper concludes that there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between DL design, driver behaviour, and traffic performance. It identifies knowledge gaps and proposes a research agenda to address these gaps, including the need for specifying vehicle types allowed on DLs, understanding behavioural adaptation of drivers, and improving demarcations and signage. The paper emphasizes the importance of a hybrid research approach combining driving simulator and simulation studies to compensate for the limitations of individual methodologies.",
