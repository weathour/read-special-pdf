    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art and technical trends of intelligent and connected vehicle (ICV) are illustrated. The ICV system architecture included the value chain, technology chain and industrial chain. The four stages of ICVs were the advanced assistance, connected assistance, cooperative automation and highly fully automated driving. Some key technologies of ICVs were introduced such as environmental perception, decision making, dynamical control, human-machine copilot, V2X communication and platform, cyber security. Therefore, China should develop the ICV industry rely on the top-down design by using the national institutional advantages because the ICV will be an important direction of the automotive technology in the future, and the ICV development is a great opportunity for the transformation and upgrading of China's automobile industry.",
    "methodology": "Literature review and technical analysis of ICV technologies and trends.",
    "conclusion": "ICV provides safer, more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and comfortable transportation solutions. It is a crucial component of urban intelligent transportation systems and a core element in building a green automotive society. China should leverage its institutional advantages and top-down design to develop ICV technology and industry.",
