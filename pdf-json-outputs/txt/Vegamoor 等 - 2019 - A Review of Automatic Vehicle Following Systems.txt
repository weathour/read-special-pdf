Abstract | There has been considerable interest recently in the develop-
ment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Automatic vehicle 

following capability is central for CAVs; in this article, we provide a review 

of the critical issues in the longitudinal control design for automatic vehi-

cle following systems (AVFS) employed by CAVs. This expository review 

differs from others in providing a review of underlying methodologies for 

design of AVFS and the impact of AVFS on traffic mobility and safety.

1  Introduction
Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are 
being  developed  by  automobile  companies,  and 
from 
are 
researchers  and  policy  makers.1  An  autonomous 
vehicle (AV) decides its control actions based on 
the available information from its on-board sen-
sors; a CAV has an additional wireless communi-
cation capability, by means of which it can gather 
information  about  vehicles  or  the  traffic,  it  may 
not  readily  sense  with  its  on-board  sensors.  A 
vehicle equipped with advanced driver assist sys-
tems (ADAS) such as adaptive cruise control sys-
tem  (ACC)  or  lane  keep  assist  may  be  viewed  as 
an inceptive AV. One can expect to see CACC  or 
advanced CACC systems (referred to as CACC
+
systems)  in  the  first  generation  of  CAVs.  ACC 
relies  only  on  on-board  sensory  information, 
while  vehicles  equipped  with  a  CACC  System, 
currently in production only in Japan, utilize the 
preceding vehicle’s acceleration communicated by 
a  wireless  system.  Next  generation  of  CAVs  is 
expected to be equipped with CACC
 systems to 
exploit  vehicle-to-vehicle  (V2V)  and  vehicle-to-
infrastructure (V2I) connectivity to obtain infor-
mation  about  multiple  preceding  vehicles  or 
traffic downstream and respond appropriately.

The  anticipated  benefits  of  CAVs  include 
enhanced traffic safety stemming from a reduced 
reaction  time  of  machines,  convenience  and 
improved  mobility  and  fuel  economy,  especially 
in  the  case  of  trucks.  The  projected  path  to  the 
eventual  deployment  of  CAVs  from  the  current 

state  passes  through  future  states  of  technology 
where  vehicles  possess  different  levels  of  auton-
omy:2, 3 Level 0 describes the (past) state of vehi-
cles where drivers are completely in charge. Level 
1 (current state) of autonomy still has the driver 
in  control  of  the  vehicle  ,but  includes  Advanced 
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) that automate 
certain  driving  tasks,  i.e.,  maintaining  speed, 
vehicle  following,  or  lane  keeping  is  automated. 
In  Level  2  of  autonomy  (referred  to  as  partial 
automation),  the  driver  monitors  the  environ-
ment at all times and is engaged in driving tasks, 
but the combined task of lane keeping and vehicle 
following  is  automated.  In  Level  3  of  autonomy 
(referred to as conditional autonomy), the driver 
is not required to monitor the environment at all 
times, but must be prepared to take control of the 
vehicle  at  all  times  with  a  short  notice.  In  Level 
4 of autonomy (referred to as high automation), 
the  vehicle  will  be  capable  of  driving  autono-
mously  in  some  situations;  the  driver  will  have 
the  option  of  controlling  the  vehicle.  In  Level  5 
of autonomy (referred to as full automation), the 
vehicle  will  be  capable  of  driving  autonomously 
in  all  situations;  yet,  the  driver  will  have  the 
option of controlling the vehicle. It is safe to say 
that  the  current  state  of  technology  in  commer-
cially  available  cars  has  not  provably  surpassed 
Level 2 (partial automation).

An automatic vehicle following system (AVFS) 
is a central subsystem of AVs and CAVs. ACC and 
CACC systems are two types of AVFS. Design of 
an  AVFS,  a  topic  of  active  investigation  for  the 

Adaptive cruise control: A 
driver assistance feature found 
in many modern cars that 
uses sensors like radars and 
cameras to measure distance 
to the vehicle in front and 
regulate speed accordingly.

Cooperative adaptive cruise 
control: Instead of relying 
only on passive sensors, a 
CACC system communicates 
with other cars to obtain 
better estimates of the state 
of surrounding vehicles while 
typically broadcasting its 
own state. This collectively 
improves vehicle following.

towards  the  taste  of  the  authors.  In  this  review 
article,  we  will  briefly  review  various  aspects  of 
designing AVFS systems—(a) vehicle models, (b) 
string  stability  in  nominal  maneuvers,  (c)  infor-
mation flow and its relation to string stability, (d) 
traffic  flow  modeling  with  CAVs,  and  (e)  traffic 
safety  in  emergency  braking  maneuvers.  This 
article  is  organized  as  follows:  in  Sect.  2,  we  dis-
cuss prominent models of vehicles that have been 
employed  to  design  vehicle  following  control 
algorithms. In Sect. 3, we revisit the definition of 
string stability. In Sect. 4, we review two spacing 
policies—namely,  constant  spacing  policy  and 
constant time headway policy and review the lit-
erature  on  control  algorithms  for  a  vehicle 
employing these policies. In Sect. 5, we review the 
issues associated with modeling the flow of traffic 
with  CAVs  and  provide  a  preliminary  model.  In 
Sect. 6, we review metrization of traffic safety for 
AVFS,  especially  during  emergency  braking 
maneuvers.

2   Vehicle Models
To design a controller for an AVFS using available 
information,  one  requires  a  vehicle  model.  One 
often  uses  a  model  that  captures  the  essence  of 
longitudinal dynamics—to accurately predict the 
motion  of  a  vehicle  when  subject  to  inputs  that 
are varying sufficiently slowly. Since one does not 
expect  velocity  of  a  vehicle  to  decrease  rapidly, 
and since inertia of a vehicle is sufficiently large, 
and  the  objective  is  to  regulate  the  speed  and 
position of a vehicle, the model must be reasona-
bly  accurate  to  predict  the  speed  of  a  vehicle  in 
response  to  low-frequency  brake  and  throttle 
inputs. In Ref.6, several models for a vehicle with 
Spark-Ignition  (SI)  engine  were  provided  whose 
fidelity  depends  on  the  underlying  assumptions. 

Time headway: Time headway 
between two vehicles can be 
interpreted as the difference 
between the time taken for 
the two vehicles to pass some 
common point in their path

past  50  years,  has  two  important  components: 
choice of a spacing policy and an associated con-
trol system. A spacing policy dictates the desired 
following  distance  of  a  CAV  as  a  function  of  its 
speed, while the control system is concerned with 
regulating  the  following  distance  at  its  desired 
value with the information available to  the  CAV. 
AVFS  couples  the  motion  of  CAVs  (or  simply 
vehicles)  through  feedback,  and  consequently, 
errors  in  maintaining  a  desired  following  dis-
tance  and  velocity  can  propagate  in  a  collection 
of  vehicles  employing  AVFS.  Feedback  requires 
information  about  other  vehicles  in  traffic;  an 
underlying  information  flow  graph  specifies  the 
set  of  vehicles  in  the  traffic  whose  information 
the  controlled  vehicle  possesses.  Depending  on 
the  underlying  information  flow  graph,  ampli-
fication of errors in spacing can occur and often 
result in chain collisions or pileups.

Enhancements  in  traffic  safety,  in  the  context 
of AVFS  for  CAVs,  can  be  characterized  through  a 
reduction  in,  if  not  elimination  of,  rear-end  col-
lisions.  Enhancing  traffic  safety  at  the  expense 
of  traffic  efficiency  or  vice  versa  is  not  desirable. 
For  example,  mobility  is  enhanced  (via  increased 
throughput and associated congestion relief) when 
smaller  following  distances  are  employed  in  auto-
matic vehicle following or platooning applications;4, 
5;  however,  from  a  safety  viewpoint,  tight  follow-
ing distances also leave little margins to account for 
parasitic actuation/sensing lags or imperfections in 
communication and control. The problem of safety 
can  be  compounded  by  heterogeneity  of  vehicles 
stemming from having different sensing, actuation, 
braking, and communication systems.

Rear-end collisions can occur with or without a 
following vehicle fully applying its inputs (brakes or 
throttle). As CAVs are coupled dynamically by feed-
back, the latter type of collisions can be examined 
via string stability, i.e., attenuation of spacing errors 
in  maintaining  desired  safe  following  distances. 
Often, spacing error amplification in a string results 
in pileups and is a function of the information flow 
among  vehicles,  the  desired  following  distance, 
parasitic  sensing/actuation  lags,  communication 
imperfections  such  as  packet  drops,  quantization 
of  transmitted  signals,  etc.  Maneuvers  of  the  lead 
vehicle that do not result in any vehicle fully apply-
ing its throttle/brake will be referred to as nominal 
maneuvers.  Rear-end  collisions  are  more  likely  to 
occur  in  an  emergency  braking  maneuver  when  a 
lead vehicle in a string applies its brake fully (result-
ing in its maximum deceleration) to avoid colliding 
with an obstacle in front.

The  scope  of  AVFS  literature  is  too  vast  and 
any  review  is  bound  to  be  restrictive  and  biased

V. K. Vegamoor et al.1 3They  provide  the  following  lumped  parameter 
model  involving  five  states—ma  (mass  of  air  in 
the  intake  manifold),  we  (rotational  speed  of  a 
Spark-Ignition (SI) engine), wt (speed of the tur-
bine of the torque converter), v (vehicle’s longitu-
dinal  speed),  and Tb  (brake  torque);  the  variable 
Pm (pressure in the intake manifold) is related to 
ma through the ideal gas law:

Pm = ma

RTm
Vm

,

where R is the gas constant for air, Tm is the intake 
manifold  temperature  (assumed  to  be  the  ambi-
ent  temperature),  and Vm  is  the  volume  of  the 
intake manifold, a constant. Pressure in the intake 
manifold  evolves  according  to  the  balance  of 
mass of air, while the speed evolution of engine, 
transmission,  and  vehicle  speed  are  governed 
by  the  balance  of  linear  and  angular  momen-
tum  equations.  Brake  pressure  (and  hence  brake 
torque, Tb ) evolution depends on the bulk modu-
lus  of  the  brake  fluid  in  the  master  cylinder  and 
is  described  by  the  Navier–Stokes  fluid  model. 
Inputs  to  the  vehicle  are  α  (throttle  angle)  and 
Tbc (Brake torque commanded). The parameter rt 
represents the tire radius. The form of the evolu-
tion equations is given below:

ma = ˙ma,in(α, Pm) − ˙ma,out(Pm, we),
˙

Ie ˙we =Tnet(we, Pm) − Tpump(we, wt),

It ˙wt =Tturb(we, wt) − R∗(Tb + rtFtr),

M ˙v =Ftr − cav2 − Ff ,

(1)

(2)

(3)

(5)

τ ˙Tb + Tb =Tbc.
In (1), the right-hand side represents the net rate 
of  accumulation  of  mass  of  air;  the  incoming 
rate,  ˙ma,in , is a function of the throttle angle and 
the pressure in the intake manifold. Higher intake 
manifold  pressure  or  lower  throttle  angle  less-
ens  the  entry  rate  of  mass  of  air  into  the  intake 
manifold. Similarly, the outgoing rate of mass of 
air,  ˙ma,out  into  the  cylinders  is  a  function  of  the 
engine speed and intake manifold pressure. Note 
that  ˙ma,out  is  an  increasing  function  of  its  argu-
ments. The term  Ie in (2) represents the engine’s 
lumped  rotational  inertia  (including  inertia  of 
the  flywheel),  the  net  engine  torque,  and Tnet  is 
a function of we and  Pm . For vehicles with auto-
matic  transmission,  the  engine  is  connected  to 
the pump side of the torque converter, while the 
transmission  is  connected  to  the  turbine  side. 
The torques at the pump side and turbine side are 
Tpump  and Tturb ,  respectively.  A  tacit  assumption 

Torque converter: A hydraulic 
coupling typically used in 
automatic transmission vehi-
cles in place of a mechanical 
clutch.

Engine map: The function 
that describes the torque 
output by an engine, given 
the current angular speed of 
the engine shaft and throttle 
input.

in  the  models  given  in  Ref.6  is  that  all  the  shafts 
are  rigid.  The  term  It  in  (3)  represents  the 
reflected inertia of all gears and the term Ftr is the 
traction  force  at  the  tire–road  interface,  and  the 
gear reduction (due to differential and gear box) 
is represented by  R∗ . In (4), M denotes the mass 
of  the  vehicle,  ca  is  the  aerodynamic  drag  coef-
ficient,  and  Ff   is  the  rolling  resistance.  The  time 
constant for the brake subsystem is assumed to be 
a constant τ as given in (5).

The  functions  ˙ma,in, ˙ma,out, Tnet  are  obtained 
experimentally  and  are  usually  in  the  form  of 
a  look-up  table.  The  same  is  the  case  with  the 
torque  converter  charts  which  specify Tpump  and 
Tturb in a tabular manner using Kotwicki’s7 quasi-
static  model.  A  constitutive  model  is  specified 
for  Ftr  as  a  function  of  longitudinal  slip  and  the 
axle load. This model is not amenable for control 
design for a variety of reasons—for example, one 
may  not  have  the  measurement  of  speeds  (espe-
cially vehicle speed of sufficient accuracy that can 
used  for  the  computation  of  longitudinal  slip). 
In this case, when all the state measurements are 
unavailable,  the  corresponding  output  feedback 
control design problem is still open for non-linear 
systems. Second, it is not clear if the performance 
improvement based on a detailed model justifies 
the need for additional sensory information that 
is required of the corresponding controllers.

Since the control inputs are α and Tbc , the distur-
bances  (such  as  (i)  uncertainty  entering  the  system 
owing  to  inadequate  knowledge  of  engine  maps  or 
(ii) torque converter charts or the constitutive rela-
tionships  for  the  traction  force)  influence  the  out-
puts (velocity or position of the vehicle) sooner than 
the control inputs; in this case, matching conditions 
are  not  satisfied  for  the  non-linear  vehicle  model 
listed  above.  This  mismatched  non-linear  system 
together with inaccurate knowledge of engine maps 
or  torque  converter  charts  or  the  constitutive  rela-
tionships makes the control problem even harder.

One, therefore, resorts to simplifying assump-
tions  to  get  a  simpler  model  for  control;  for 
example, the following assumptions lead to a sim-
plification of the vehicle model to a second-order 
model6: (a) pressure evolution in the intake mani-
fold is much faster compared to the evolution of 
engine  speed,  (b)  torque  converter  is  locked,  (c) 
there is no slip between the wheel and the ground, 
and (d) braking is instantaneous, i.e., τ = 0 . Using 
these simplifying assumptions, the resulting equa-
tion of motion of a vehicle is given by:

A Review of Automatic Vehicle Following Systems1 3This  model  is  amenable  for  control  design  by 
treating  Tnet − R∗Tbc  as  a  control  input;  by 
choosing

Tnet − R∗Tbc = R∗rtFr + R∗rtcav2 + (Ie + (R∗)2Mr2

t )u,

where  u  is  the  synthetic  control  input  (com-
manded  acceleration).  A  similar  approach  is 
adopted  for  trucks,8  9]  where  u  (commanded 
acceleration)  is  considered  as  a  synthetic  input; 
the  same  I/O  linearization  approach  holds  with 
trucks that are equipped with Compression-Igni-
tion (CI) engines. In this case, Tnet is a function of 
the velocity and throttle (fuel) command and the 
braking dynamics is different owing to pneumatic 
brakes being used in trucks in place of passenger 
brakes.  This  leads  to  the  following  input–output 
linearized vehicle model for control design:

¨
xi = ui,

(7)

where  xi  is  the  position  of  the  ith  vehicle  and ui 
is  the  control  input  (force/unit  mass)  to  the  ith 
vehicle.

The  model  should  be  notionally  understood 
as  follows:  the  acceleration  of  a  vehicle  can  be 
controlled  arbitrarily  (through  an  appropri-
ate  choice  of  throttle/brake).  In  this  sense,  het-
erogeneity should not be a problem for nominal 
vehicle  maneuvers  as  the  values  of  acceleration/
deceleration  are  well  within  the  capabilities  of 
vehicles,  despite  their  being  different  structur-
ally. It must be admitted that feedback lineariza-
tion  presumes  exact  knowledge  of  parameters, 
functional  forms  for  resistance,  and  unlimited 
actuation  ability;  however,  one  may  view  this  as 
a  first  step  in  the  study  of  heterogeneous  collec-
tions  in  this  quantitative  fashion.  This  model  is 
extensively  used  in  the  development  of  vehicle 
following  control  laws  for  the  following  reasons: 
(1)  lower  level  control  design  employs  feedback 
linearization to render the model to be homoge-
neous and linear (I/O linearized); (2) braking or 
acceleration  limits  are  not  attained  during  most 
vehicle  maneuvers;  and  (3)  platooning  experi-
ments  in  the  literature,  and  especially,  those  at 
California  PATH,  conducted  under  a  number  of 
scenarios  with  controllers  developed  with  this 
approach have been satisfactory.

While this model assumes instantaneous actu-
ation,  it  is  never  the  case  in  practice.  To  test  the 
robustness of controllers, one usually analyzes the 
designed  controllers  for  robustness  by  consider-
ing the following singularly perturbed model for 
longitudinal vehicle dynamics:
τ ˙fi + fi = ui,

¨
xi =fi,

(8)

where  fi  is  the  force/unit  mass  applied  to  the 
vehicle and τ is an uncertain parameter that mod-
els  the  time  constant  of  the  inner  loop  control 
systems that regulate brake pressure in the wheels 
or  the  engine  speed  based  on  the  commanded 
acceleration  command.  As  mentioned  before, 
it  is  difficult  to  model  the  inner  loop  dynamics 
of  engines  with  the  associated  complexities  of 
combustion  and  fluid  flow  in  the  engine,  intake 
manifold and torque converter, compliance in the 
shafts, and, more importantly, the tire–road inter-
actions.  From  the  speed  response  of  a  vehicle  to 
throttle  and  brake  pedal  input,  one  can  empiri-
cally  bound  the  maximum  lag  in  the  response; 
in  reality,  there  is  time  delay  in  the  braking  and 
torque  production  processes.10–13  This  model 
may  be  seen  as  an  approximation  for  the  time-
delay  systems,  where  the  delay  is  lumped  along 
with  the  lag  in  the  response. We  use τ0  to  repre-
sent the upper bound of τ.

τ

Other  vehicle  models  have  also  been  used  in 
the  literature;  for  electric  vehicles  such  as  Toy-
ota  Prius,  Ploeg  et  al.14  used  a  third-order  lin-
ear  model  for  experimentally  demonstrating 
the  reduction  in  time  headway  possible  through 
Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC):
...
x i + ¨xi = ui.
Sheikholeslam  and  Desoer15  used  this  model, 
where τ is a function of  ˙xi . As mentioned before, 
the  functional  characterization  of  τ  is  far  from 
easy;11  Bender  et  al.16  and  Takasaki  et  al.17  have 
used the best linear fit of τ from the experimen-
tal data. This model is suitable for electric power 
trains  as  the  model  for  the  electrical  part  of  the 
motor  can  be  better  approximated  by  a  deter-
ministic  first-order  linear  system  unlike  vehicles 
with  gasoline  or  diesel  engines—as  mentioned 
earlier,  the  uncertainty  in  the  engine  maps  and 
the lag in their response is higher. The results in 
this paper also apply to this model. Swaroop and 
Hedrick18–20  were  the  first  to  introduce  singular 
perturbations for string stability analysis in CAVs; 
the  introduction  was  carried  through  with  this 
first-order lag model.

Traffic  engineering  researchers21,  22  used  a 
delayed acceleration model for their car-following 
theories and this is relevant here:

¨
xi = ui(t − ∆),

where  ∆  is  the  reaction  time  of  the  combined 
vehicle–driver  system.  While  this  model  reflects 
the time delays in reaction time of the drivers, the 
controller  incorporated  velocity  feedback  with 
respect  to  the  leader.  In  the  case  of  Ref.23,  there 
were  additional  feedback  terms  reflecting  the

V. K. Vegamoor et al.1 3where  there  is  a  step  change  in  its  steady-state 
velocity,  it  is  required  that  the  spacing  error 
remains bounded spatially and temporally. More-
over, the error must decay asymptotically in time 
while following its predecessor. If ei(t) represents 
the spacing error of the ith following vehicle, the 
following  definitions  of  string  stability,  intro-
duced  by  Chu26  and  generalized  in  Ref.18,  have 
been used extensively in the literature:

(String  Stability)  A  string  is  stable  if 
Definition 
given ǫ > 0 , there exists a δ(ǫ) > 0 (independent 
of the size of the string), such that

max{|ei(0)|, |˙ei(0)|} < δ

sup
i

=⇒ sup

max{|ei(t)|, |˙ei(t)|}

(cid:30)

(9)

< ǫ.

sup
t≥0

i (cid:31)

A  string  is  asymptotically  string  stable  if  it  is 
string stable and limt→∞ supi |ei(t)| → 0.

A  convenient  way  to  visualize  string  stabil-
ity is to use spacing error plots. Using simulated 
or  empirical  data,  by  observing  errors  ei(t)  for 
each  vehicle  i,  the  stability  of  a  platoon  can  be 
ascertained. Figures 1 and 2 provide examples of 
spacing  error  trajectories  from  a  stable  and  an 
unstable  platoon  respectively,  when  the  platoon 
leader performs an emergency braking maneuver. 
Only  the  first,  third,  and  fifth  errors  are  shown 
here  for  clarity.  While  all  the  errors  in  both  fig-
ures  eventually  diminish  with  time  in  this  case, 
we can observe that the supt≥0 |e5| is smaller than 
supt≥0 |e1| in the string stable case, indicating that 
errors  are  bounded  and  diminish  down  the  pla-
toon.  On  the  other  hand,  in  Fig.  2,  the  spacing 
errors  appear  to  amplify  as  we  move  away  from 
the platoon leader, indicating an unstable string.

One  may  question  even  the  relevance  of  the 
ǫ − δ  definition  in  so  far  as  its  ability  to  capture 
the  collision-avoidance  capability  of  a AVFS  sys-
tem  in  CAVs.  As  long  as  ǫ  is  sufficiently  smaller 
than  the  minimum  desired  following  distance 
of  CAVs  in  a  string,  collision  avoidance  can  be 
guaranteed.  However,  this  would  require  the 
initial  spacing  errors  to  be  sufficiently  small,  as 
well; here is where the trouble could possibly lie. 
Another  shortcoming  of  this  definition  is  that 
the  effect  of  disturbing  forces  (disturbances  in 
control  systems  parlance)  on  the  propagation  of 
spacing  errors  is  not  captured.  Recently,  Ploeg 
et  al.27,  and  Besselink  and  Knorn28  introduced 
the  following  definition  of “scalable”  input-state 
stability:  consider  a  string  of  N  vehicles  with  Si 

delay in obtaining measurements from preceding 
vehicles.

Since  parameters  such  as  mass  of  the  vehicle 
can  change  from  one  trip  to  another  depending 
on the number of passengers and their attendant 
baggage, Eq. (6) is adapted for this purpose:24
Mtotal ¨x = Fi − C ˙x2 − Ff ,
t  , Fi = Tnet − R∗Tb , 
where Mtotal = Ie + (R∗)2Mr2
C = (R∗)2car2
t  ,  and  Ff = (R∗)2r2
this 
model,  the  uncertain  parameters  that  are  to  be 
estimated  in  real  time  are  Mtotal—the  effective 
inertia  of  the  vehicle,  C—the  effective  aerody-
namic drag coefficient, and  Ff —the effective tire 
drag coefficient.

Autonomous  ground  vehicle  platforms  are 
being  commercially  supplied  by  companies  such 
as  AutonomouStuff  Inc.  In  these  platforms,  the 
companies  provide  an  inner  loop  controller,  the 
command to which is the desired velocity of the 
vehicle. One would naturally be tempted to use a 
first-order integrator model in such a scenario:

˙
xi = ui,

where  ui  is  the  commanded  speed.  Such  a  first-
order integrator model is simply unsuited for the 
analysis of string stability in AVFS as documented 
in Ref.25

3   String Stability
Consider a string of vehicles traveling in a single 
straight lane with a leader indexed by 0 and fol-
lowing vehicles indexed in sequence by {1, 2, . . .} . 
String  stability  concerns  the  following  scenario: 
the  leader  makes  an  acceleration/deceleration 
maneuver  and  every  following  vehicle  tries  to 
maintain  a  desired  following  distance  specified 
by the AVFS. When the leader makes a maneuver

A Review of Automatic Vehicle Following Systems1 3stability referred to spatial attenuation of spacing 
errors.16,  32  The  analysis  of  string  stability  relies 
on  controllers  designed  based  on  feedback  line-
arization of the vehicle model or Jacobi lineariza-
tion of the vehicle model. This allows for analysis 
of  propagation  of  spacing  errors  using  Laplace 
transformations  of  the  relevant  signals.  Let  Ei(s) 
denote the Laplace transformation of the spacing 
error ei(t) ; furthermore, let a0(t) be the accelera-
tion of the lead vehicle with its Laplace transfor-
mation  denoted  by  A0(s) .  Let  H(s),  G(s)  denote 
proper rational transfer functions. For appropri-
ate H(s), G(s) that are determined by the control 
laws  employed  by  the  AVFS,  the  error  propaga-
tion  equations  associated  with  a  single-vehicle 
look-ahead  control  system  may  be  described 
using Laplace transformation as:

E1(s) = G(s)A0(s),

Ei(s) = H (s)Ei−1(s),

∀i ≥ 2.

(10)
It is usually the case that the poles of the transfer 
function  G(s)  and  the  error  propagation  trans-
fer  function  H(s)  are  identical  and  they  can  be 
designed  to  ensure  that  every  pole  has  a  nega-
tive  real  part.  For  a  single-vehicle  look-ahead, 
the  error  propagation  transfer  function  is  con-
strained, so that H(0) = 1.

Fenton and Bender16, 32 use the velocity v0(t) , 
of  the  lead  vehicle  as  the  input  to  transfer  func-
tion  G(s)  in  place  of  a0(t) ;  they  provide  a  fre-
quency  domain  condition  �G(jw)�∞ ≤ 1  for 
non-amplification  of  any  velocity  disturbances 
from  the  lead  vehicle  to  the  first  following  vehi-
cle.  In  the  subsequent  literature,  for  instance15, 
18,  33–35  use �H(jw)�∞ ≤ 1  to  specify  the  attenu-
ation  of  spacing  errors.  Utilizing  this  condition 
as  a  definition  for  string  stability  still  has  some 
shortcomings:

•   Error  propagation  with  controllers  utilizing 
feedback  from  multiple  vehicles  has  different 
structure of error propagation equations than 
Eq.  (10).  Hence,  this  definition  will  not  hold 
in this scenario both in theory and practice.
•   Even for a single-vehicle look-ahead scenario, 
one  must  show  that �H(jw)�∞ ≤ 1  leads  to 
a  vehicle  platoon  satisfying  string  stability 
according  to  its ǫ − δ  definition  above.  From 
Linear  System  Theory,36  �H(jw)�∞  norm 
relates  the  two-norm  of  the  output, (cid:31)ei(t)(cid:31)2 , 
with  the  two-norm  of  the  input, �ei−1(t)�2 , 
using the following inequality: 

�ei(t)�2 ≤ �H(jw)�∞�ei−1(t)�2.

vides a way to accommodate disturbances acting

tions)  the  deleterious  effects  of  amplification  of 
disturbances.29–31  For  example,  analysis  appeal-
ing  to  this  approach  is  heavily  used  by  treating 
the  sinusoidal  acceleration  of  the  lead  vehicle  as 
the only disturbance acting on the string of vehi-
cles and, subsequently, analyzing how the spacing 
error amplitudes evolve spatially.

V. K. Vegamoor et al.1 3  While �H(jw)�∞ ≤ 1  ensures  that  the  two 
norms of spacing errors do not amplify, from 
a  safety  point  of  view,  what  is  required  is  a 
relation that ensures that the maximum spac-
ing errors do not amplify for collision avoid-
ance, i.e., 

�ei(t)�∞ ≤ �ei−1(t)�∞.
 It is known from Ref.36 that 

�ei(t)�∞ ≤ �h(t)�1�ei−1(t)�∞,

  where  h(t)  is  the  unit  impulse  response  of 
the  transfer  function  H(s).  For  any  natural 
number  p,  it  is  also  known  that  if γp  is  the 
pth  induced  norm  of  the  error  propagation 
transfer function, H(s), that is 

γp := sup

  Either  (a)  one  must  design  the  error  prop-
agation  transfer  function,  H(s)  to  have  its 
unit  impulse  response,  h(t) ≥ 0 ,  so  that 
�h(t)�1 = H(0) = 1 , 
thereby  guaranteeing 
�ei(t)�∞ ≤ �ei−1(t)�∞  or  (b)  use  mixed-
norm  bounds,  specifically,  those  that  relate 
�ei−1(t)�2  to  �ei(t)�∞ .  Sheikholeslam  and 
Desoer15  specify  the  desirability  of  h(t) ≥ 0 . 
For  a  general  plant,  it  is  difficult  to  ascer-
tain  if  h(t)  can  be  made  non-negative  with 
the  choice  of  controller  parameter  gains 
that  affect  the  coefficients  of  the  numerator 
and  denominator  polynomials  of  the  error 
propagation  transfer  function  H(s);  this 
problem  is  tied  closely  to  the  open  problem 
of transient control in linear control systems. 
If �H(jw)�∞ < 1  (and  this  can  be  the  case 
if  the  lead  vehicle’s  position  information  is 
available and appropriately fed back to every 
vehicle in the string), then one can make use 
of the inequalities that relate the (cid:31)h(t)(cid:31)1 with 
37, 38 through the McMillan degree, 
�H(jw)�∞
n, of H(s): 

�h(t)�1 ≤ (2n + 1)�H(jw)�∞.

 If one were to consider the head-to-tail trans-
fer  function,38  Ei(s)
E1(s) = H i−1(s) ,  its  McMillan 
degree  will  increase  linearly  (as  the  number 
of  states  for  its  realization  will  increase  lin-
early),  while  �H i−1(jw)�∞ = �H (jw)�i−1 

∞ �e1�∞.

decreases geometrically. Combining, one can 
conclude that 
�ei�∞ ≤ (2ni + 1)�H(jw)�i−1
  However,  this  method  can  only  provide 
some sort of assurance for non-amplification 
of  spacing  errors  if �H(jw)�∞ < 1  and  cer-
tainly, not when H(0) = 1.
Only  recently,  Vegamoor  and  Darbha39 
explored  the  option  (b):  under  the  reason-
able assumptions that the acceleration of the 
lead  vehicle  is  (i)  bounded  and  (ii)  square 
integrable,  results  from  Ref.36  assure  that 
spacing  error  in  any  following  vehicle  is 
bounded  temporally  and  is  squared  integra-
ble,  i.e., �ei(t)�∞  and (cid:31)ei(t)(cid:31)2  are  bounded; 
�ei(t)�2 ≤ �ei−1(t)�2 
furthermore, 
for  i ≥ 2 .  However,  from  Corless,  Zhu, 
and  Skelton,40  one  can  show  that  there  is 
a  K , L > 0 ,  such  that  �ei�∞ ≤ �ei−1�2  and 
�e1(t)�∞ ≤ L�a0(t)�2 .  This  would  in  turn 
imply that for all i ≥ 2 : 

that 

�ei(t)�∞ ≤ K |ei−1|2 ≤ K �e1�2 ≤ KL�a0(t)�2,

  indicating  that  the  maximum  spacing  error 
does not amplify spatially.

In general, if Si is the set of vehicles whose infor-
mation is available and fed back by the ith vehicle 
in  the  platoon,  the  error  propagation  will  be  of 
the form:

Ei(s) =

Hj(s)Ej(s) + Wi(s)Di(s),

j∈Si
(cid:31)

where  Wi(s)  relates  how  the  disturbance,  Di(s) , 
influences  the  spacing  error  in  the  ith  vehicle. 
The  lead  vehicle’s  acceleration  can  be  treated  as 
a  disturbance  and  lumped  with  individual  dis-
turbances acting on the system in defining Di(s) . 
One  can  associate  an  information  flow  graph, 
where vehicles in the string serve as nodes and the 
directed edge (i, j) is in the allowable set of edges 
in the graph if  j ∈ Si . The propagation of spacing 
errors  is  not  only  influenced  by  the  underlying 
information  flow  graph  but  also  dependent  on 
the spacing policy employed by CAVs.

Information  flow  graphs  studied  initially  in 
the  literature  concerned  with  Si = {i − 1, i}  (tri-
angular  or  look-ahead  structure16,  26).  Peppard 
et  al.33  considered  the  case  Si = {i − 1, i, i + 1}. 
Until  the  California  PATH  program,  V2V  com-
munication  capability  was  virtually  absent  and 
information  was  primarily  sensed  from  neigh-
boring vehicles ,and hence, the information flow 
graphs  were  naturally  restricted.  Swaroop  and 
Hedrick18, 41 were the first to generalize the struc-
ture  to  Si = {i − r ≤ j ≤ i} .  Fax  and  Murray42

symmetric architectures. For symmetric architec-
tures, Graph Laplacians were first introduced for 
analysis of rigid formations in Ref.42.

3.1   Methods of Analysis of String 

Stability

The  problem  of  string  stability  has  a  temporal 
variable  and  a  spatial  variable.  Consequently, 
string  stability  can  be  analyzed  by  transforming 
the errors with respect to the spatial variable first 
and  considering  the  resulting  differential  equa-
tion (this approach is taken in Refs.26, 43. One can 
also  transform  the  temporal  variable  along  with 
the  spatial  variable  and  adopt  a  2-D  polynomial 
approach to study string stability, as in Refs.44, 45 
based on the results of Kamen’s work in the col-
lection.46  Essentially,  this  approach  implies  the 
following  polynomial, ∆(s, z) ,  to  be  Hurwitz  for 
every  z : |z| = 1  for  the  system  to  be  Bounded 
Input Bounded Output (BIBO) stable:

∆(s, z) := zr −

Hj(s)zr−j.

r

j=1
(cid:31)

Another  approach  is  to  use  Laplace  transforma-
tion  to  transform  the  temporal  signals  and  ana-
lyze  the  sequence  of  signals—the  approach  that 
has already been introduced tacitly in this paper. 
This  approach  has  the  advantage  that  it  can  be 
generalized  to  analyzing  the  string  stability  of 
interconnected  non-linear  systems18  through  the 
converse stability theorems; one often is left with 
difference  inequalities  as  opposed  to  difference 
equations  with  this  approach,  but  comparison 
principle47 can be employed to make the desired 
inference.

4   Design of AVFS
The design of an AVFS requires a spacing policy, 
i.e., the specification of desired following distance 
as  a  function  of  vehicle’s  speed.  Spacing  policies 
are  of  two  types:  (a)  the  Constant  Spacing  (CS) 
policy, where the desired following distance does 
not  vary  with  vehicle’s  speed,  and  (b)  a  variable 
spacing  policy,  where  the  desired  following  dis-
tance changes with vehicle’s speed. Of the variable 
spacing  policies,  the  Constant-Time  Headway 
(CTH)  policy  is  the  most  widely  considered  in 
the  literature;  in  this  policy,  the  desired  follow-
ing  distance  varies  linearly  with  vehicle’s  speed 
and the proportionality constant is referred to the 
time headway or time gap.

The  choice  of  a  spacing  policy  can  have  wide 
ramifications  on  traffic  safety  and  mobility;  not 

only  will  the  spacing  policy  dictate  the  informa-
tion that should be available to a controlled vehicle 
to  guarantee  string  stability,  but  also  will  influ-
ence the dynamics  and  stability of the movement 
of  traffic,  thereby  traffic  mobility. When  studying 
traffic  dynamics,  there  are  two  approaches  that 
have  traditionally  been  used—the  microscopic  or 
car-following  approach,  much  like  the  design  of 
AVFS,  and  the  macroscopic  or  traffic  flow  mod-
eling approach. In the former approach, one mod-
els the car-following behavior of traffic, and in the 
later, one looks at traffic at a larger spatial scale and 
is interested in the aggregate dynamics of vehicles 
in a section of a highway. Steady-state behavior of 
traffic  at  the  macroscopic  level  is  often  character-
ized  by  Fundamental  Traffic  Characteristic  (FTC) 
in civil engineering literature; essentially, this curve 
relates  how  the  following  distance  between  vehi-
cles (reciprocally related to “traffic density”) affects 
the  speed  and,  hence,  the  traffic  throughput  in  a 
section.

The connection between these two approaches 
for  traffic  consisting  of  manually  driven  vehicles 
was first reported by Gazis, Herman, and Potts;48 
essentially, they were interested in reconciling the 
empirical  traffic  data  of  Greenberg49  with  possi-
ble  “follow-the-leader”  microscopic  models  for 
manual  driving.  Clearly,  in  the  case  of  designing 
AVFS, the specification of spacing policy is equiv-
alent  to  specifying  the  FTC  and  directly  affects 
traffic  mobility  and  operations;  this  connection 
was  first  explicitly  made  by  Darbha  and  Rajago-
pal50 and poses an inverse problem of designing a 
variable spacing policy for AVFS based on a traf-
fic specification;50, 51 subsequently, the problem of 
spacing policy design has been revisited by other 
researchers.52, 53 We will briefly review the control 
algorithms for AVFS in the following subsections.

4.1   Control Architectures for a Constant 

Spacing Policy

Let L0 be sum of the car length and the constant 
desired following distance. Let xi(t), x0(t) denote 
the respective positions of the ith following vehi-
cle  and  the  lead  vehicle  in  a  string  of  vehicles 
traveling in a straight lane. This yields the follow-
ing definition of spacing error:

ei(t) := xi(t) − x0(t) − L0.

4.1.1   PD Algorithm
The  simplest  control  law  for  an  AVFS33,  54  for 
maintaining a constant spacing is given by:

ui(t) = −kpei(t) − kv ˙ei(t).

574

J. Indian Inst. Sci.| VOL 99:4 | 567–587 December 2019 | journal.iisc.ernet.in

V. K. Vegamoor et al.1 3Note  that  the  measurements  of  ei(t), ˙ei(t)  can  be 
obtained from on-board sensors. Since vehicles are 
coupled  dynamically  by  feedback,  spacing  errors 
propagate;  the  errors  propagate  according  to  the 
following evolution equations for i ≥ 2:

ei + kv ˙ei + kpei = kvei−1 + kpei−1,
¨

and  using  Laplace  transformation,  one  can  show 
that

H (s) :=

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

kvs + kp
s2 + kvs + kp

,

and

|H(jw)|2 =

v w2
p + k2
k2
(kp − w2)2 + k2

v w2 .

If  the  lead  vehicle  was  to  perform  a  sinusoidal 
acceleration at a sufficiently low frequency (which 
is usually the case in highway driving conditions), 
the  error  in  the  first  following  vehicle  will  also 
vary with the same low frequency. From the error 
propagation  transfer  function,  it  is  clear  that  for 
a  sufficiently  small  w,  the  denominator  is  smaller 
than the numerator, implying that the amplitudes 
of oscillation of the spacing error will amplify geo-
metrically from one vehicle to another, leading to a 
pileup. Caudill and Garrard54 were the first to pro-
vide a proof of string instability with this scheme.

First-order model for a vehicle is inappropri-

ate for studying spacing error propagation:

˙
xi = ui.

with Ei(s) as its input and K(s) is a proper, rational 
controller  transfer  function.  While  Seiler  et  al.29 
use  Bode-integral  to  show  that  this  scheme  can-
not lead to string stability; the approach by Khatir 
and  Davison55  is  simpler.  The  error  propagation 
transfer function in this case is:

H (s) =

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

K (s)
s2 + K (s)

,

and

|H(jw)|2 =

Kr(w)2 + w2Ki(w)2
(Kr(w2) − w2)2 + w2K 2

i w2
i

,

where  K (jw) = Kr(w) + jwKi(w) .  It  is  not  dif-
ficult  to  see  that  Kr(0) >0   and  Ki(0) >0   for 
stability. Consequently, for a sufficiently small w, 
|H (jw)|2 > 1 leading to string instability.

4.1.3   Semi‑autonomous Control
With  communication  devices  or  with  other 
means  of  estimating  the  acceleration  of  the  pre-
ceding  vehicle,  Swaroop  and  Hedrick38  consider 
the following control law for AVFS:

ui = ka ¨xi−1 − kv ˙ei − kpei.

A schematic of such an AVFS is shown in Fig. 3, 
where  the  dotted  lines  indicate  flow  of  informa-
tion  via  wireless  channels.  In  this  case,  ¨xi−1  is 
received  by  each  vehicle  i. With  this  control  law, 
spacing errors propagate as

Since spacing error can be fed back, it is clear that

H (s) =

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

kas2 + kvs + kp
s2 + kvs + kp

.

ui = −kpei,

one  gets  an  error  propagation  transfer  function 
with just the information of the preceding vehicle 
to be:

H (s) =

kp
s + kp

.

It is clear that ka ∈ (0, 1] for �H(jw)� ≤ 1 ; moreo-
ver, if ka  = 1 , at low frequencies, the numerator of 
(cid:31)H (jw)(cid:31)2 will exceed that of the denominator as 
(kp − kaw2) >k p − w2 .  When  ka = 1 ,  H(s) ≡ 1 ; 
however,  if  one  considers  a  singularly  perturbed 
model of a vehicle, it is clear that

Clearly, this model would imply that string stabil-
ity can be guaranteed for constant spacing policy 
with just on-board sensing information.

Hp(s) =

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

s2 + kvs + kp
τ s3 + s2 + kvs + kp

.

4.1.2   Dynamic Feedback of Spacing and Velocity 

Errors

Seiler,  Pant,  and  Hedrick29  and  later,  Khatir  and 
Davison55  considered  dynamic  feedback  of  the 
form:

Ui(s) = −K (s)Ei(s),

where the control input for the ith following vehi-
cle is the output of a controller transfer function 

Even in this case, for any τ > 0 (needed for stabil-
ity and typical of any parasitic “stable” actuation), 
|Hp(jw)|2 > 1 for a sufficiently low frequency w as 
kv > kv − τ w2 .  This  case  was  the  primary  moti-
vation for the introduction of singular perturba-
tion theory in the analysis of robustness in string 
stability by Swaroop.19, 56

so  that  spacing  errors  can  be  guaranteed  not  to 
amplify;  in  this  work,  the  lead  vehicle  position 
information is not fed back, i.e., cp = 0 . In Ref.18, 
Swaroop considered the case cp > 0 and demon-
strated  geometric  attenuation  of  spacing  errors. 
Specifically,  with  lead  vehicle  velocity  informa-
tion, it is possible to design the impulse response 
of the transfer function to be non-negative,56 and 
hence,  H(0) = �h(t)�1 = 11 ;  with  lead  vehicle’s 
position information, it can be further improved 
to H(0) = �h(t)�1 = kp

4.1.5   Control  with  Lead  and  Preceding  Vehicle 

Information

A  general  form  of  the  control  law  with  such  a 
scheme is as follows18:

ui = ka ¨xi−1 + kl ¨x0 − kv ˙ei − kpei

− cv(˙xi − ˙x0) − cp(xi − x0 + iL0),

where  the  gains  ka, kl, kv, kp, cp, cv  must  be 
chosen  for  the  specific  AVFS.  This  is  illustrated 
in Fig. 5. With this scheme, the error propagation 
obeys:

H (s) =

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

kas2 + kvs + kp
s2 + (kv + cv)s + (kp + cp)

Information 

of Following Vehicles

Peppard33  considered  a  feedback  of  informa-
tion of the preceding vehicle and following vehi-
cle; however, it is not clear from this work which 
spacing  policy  was  being  adopted.  Seiler,  Pant, 
and  Hedrick29  revisited  the  problem  of  main-
taining  a  constant  following  distance  with  infor-
mation  from  the  preceding  and  immediately 
following vehicles (as illustrated in Fig. 6):

ui = −k vf (˙xi − ˙xi−1) − kpf (xi − xi−1 + L0)
− kvb(˙xi − ˙xi+1) − cvb(˙xi − ˙xi+1)
− cpb(xi − xi+1 − L0)).

Using BIBO stability arguments, Seiler et al.29 
showed  that  a  unit  disturbance  on  every  vehicle 
leads to a maximum spacing error that increases

with the size of the string. The basic intuition is 
provided in Refs.30, 31, 62: if one were to take a spa-
tially discretized cantilever beam (by taking a unit 
mass corresponding to a specified unit length of 
the beam), as shown in Fig. 7, then the resulting 
system  resembles  a  vehicle  follower  system;  the 
spring constants of the springs connecting masses 
are analogous to the position feedback gains, and 
the  damper  coefficients  correspond  to  veloc-
ity  feedback  gains.  Clearly,  as  the  length  of  the 
beam  increases,  a  unit  force  at  the  tip  results  in 
an increasing deflection at the tip; similarly, as the 
number of masses (vehicles) increases, the maxi-
mum  spacing  error  also  increases.  The  mecha-
nism of this instability is that the lowest non-zero 
natural  frequency  of  the  discretized  structure 
goes to zero as the size increases.
For  general  symmetric 

information  flow 
graphs, where  j ∈ Si ⇐⇒ i ∈ Sj , Fax and Mur-
ray42  introduced  Graph  Laplacians  for  analyz-
ing  the  stability  of  vehicle  formations.  A  Graph 
Laplacian  is  analogous  to  a  stiffness  matrix  in 
structural engineering literature and the algebraic 
connectivity  of  a  graph  is  analogous  to  the  low-
est  non-zero  natural  frequency  of  the  structure. 
Using  the  basic  intuition  about  the  mechanism 
for  string  instability,  Yadlapalli  et  al.  were  the 
first to demonstrate the limitations of symmetric 
information  flow  graphs  for  maintaining  rigid 
formations.30 The results in this paper imply that 
unless sufficient number of following vehicles (as 

a non-trivial percentage of vehicles in the string) 
have  the  lead  or  reference  vehicle’s  information, 
spacing  errors  in  maintaining  the  desired  con-
stant following distance will always increase with 
the  size  of  the  collection.  Consider  a  bridge—
unless there are sufficient props from the ground, 
as  the  length  of  the  bridge  increases,  the  maxi-
mum deflection will increase. The results in Yad-
lapalli  et  al.30  provide  insights  into  the  structure 
of  the  controllers:  if  a  controller  takes  aggregate 
error  (computed  from  communicated/sensed 
information) as an input, that is

Ui(s) = −C(s)

Ej(s),

j∈Si
(cid:31)

then  C(s)  cannot  be  strictly  proper,  or  must  not 
incorporate integral action or must not have any 
non-minimum phase zero. In each of these cases, 
if one chooses C(s), there is a limit on the size of 
string beyond which the motion of the vehicles in 
the string becomes unstable! Darbha and Pagilla63 
rule  out  symmetric  information  flow  graphs 
for  use  in  maintaining  rigid  formations  for 
unmanned vehicles (or CAVs obeying a constant 
spacing policy) from practical considerations.

Results  similar  to  Refs.30,  31,  62  can  also  be 

found in subsequent papers.64–67

4.2   Control Architectures for a 

Constant‑Time Headway Policy

Time headway was first considered in the opera-
tional  analysis  of  traffic  on  highways  by  Pipes.68 
The  advantage  of  employing  this  policy  is  that 
one  can  guarantee  string  stability  with  just  on-
board  information.35,  54,  56  Let  h  be  the  desired 
time headway, so that the error in spacing can be 
written as:

ei = xi − xi−1 + L0 + h˙xi.

4.2.1   Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)/Autonomous 

Intelligent Cruise Control (AICC)

The associated feedback control law may be given 
by:

ui = −kpei − kv(˙xi − ˙xi−1).

Note  that  ei  and  ˙xi − ˙xi−1  can  be  computed/
obtained  from  measurements  using  on-board 
sensors.  It  was  hence  referred  to  as  autonomous 
intelligent cruise control (AICC) in Ref.35; nowa-
days, this control law is implemented in ACC sys-
tems. The spacing errors in this case propagate as:

H (s) :=

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

kvs + kp
s2 + (kv + hkp)s + kp

available  preceding  vehicle’s  acceleration  can  aid 
in  string  stability  at  lower  time  headways.  The 
analytical bound on how small the time headway 
can  be  was  supplied  by  Darbha,  Konduri,  and 
Pagilla.73, 74

Associated  with  this  control  scheme,  the  con-

trol law is given by:

ui = ka ¨xi−1 − kpei − kv(˙xi − ˙xi−1).

The error propagation transfer function with per-
turbed vehicle dynamics is given by:

Hp(s) =

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

kas2 + kvs + kp
τ s3 + s2 + (kv + hkp)s + kp

.

In Ref.75, it is shown that for any given ka ∈ [0, 1) , 
there  exist  control  gains  kp, kv ,  such 
that 
�H(jw)�∞ = 1  if  h ≥ 2τ0
.  In  other  words,  one 
1+ka
can  guarantee  string  stability  with  a  lower  time 
headway for a string of vehicles employing CACC 
systems  than  with  a  string  of  vehicles  employing 
ACC systems in their AVFS. Roughly, one can cut 
the  time  headway  by  a  factor  of  half  with  CACC 

It is shown in Ref.56 that the impulse response of 
this transfer function can be made non-negative, 
rendering  1 = H(0) = �h(t)�1 ,  and  the  control 
law is effective in ensuring string stability.

Since the vehicle model was based on instan-
taneous  actuation  and  the  feedback  is  based  on 
instantaneous sensing and the processing of sens-
ing data is also assumed instantaneous, it will be 
prudent to check the robustness in string stability 
with a simple parasitic model for actuation which 
combines  all  the  lags.56  In  such  a  case,  the  error 
propagation evolves according to:

Hp(s) =

Ei(s)
Ei−1(s)

=

kvs + kp
τ s3 + s2 + (kv + hkp)s + kp

,

where  τ  is  the  unmodeled  lag  and  one  may 
assume  that  τ ≤ τ0 ,  and  τ0  is  a  known  upper 
bound on the lag. In Refs.18, 69, it is shown that it 
is possible to pick kp, kv , so that �Hp(jw)�∞ = 1 if 
h ≥ 2τ0.

For example, Figs. 8 and 9 show the effect of 
selecting  a  time  headway  on  either  side  of  the 
minimum  bound.  For  these  simulations,  the 
maximum parasitic lag in the platoon was taken 
as 0.5 s (i.e., τ0 = 0.5 s and the minimum bound, 
2τ0 = 1  s).  The  simulation  entails  the  situation 
where  the  lead  vehicle  is  initially  moving  at  a 
constant speed, and at t = 10 s, performs a hard 
braking  maneuver  for  1  s  and  resumes  constant 
velocity for the remaining part of the simulation. 
Gains ( kv, kp) were set to (0.8, 1). We can see that 
when  the  platoon  leader  performs  the  braking 
maneuver,  spacing  errors  ei  diminish  across  the 
platoon in Fig. 9, since the time headway selected 
meets the minimum bound for string stability.

4.2.2   Cooperative  Adaptive  Cruise  Control 
(CACC)/Semi‑autonomous Adaptive Cruise 
Control

The  switch  in  focus  of  automotive  companies 
from constant spacing to constant-time headway 
policy  in  their  AVFS  was  necessitated  by  lack  of 
adequate  communication/connectivity  capabil-
ity  in  the  late  1990s.  However,  the  lower  bound 
on h by unmodeled lags in the system limits how 
close vehicles can follow each other, thereby lim-
iting mobility; for example, if the unmodeled lags 
total 500 ms, a minimum time headway of 1 sec-
ond must be employed to ensure string  stability. 
However, this would translate to roughly 30 m at 
66 mph, a typical highway speed. Trucks need to 
operate at a time headway smaller than 1 s ( ≈ 0.6
–0.7  s)  to  take  advantage  of  aerodynamic  draft-
ing  to  reduce  fuel  consumption.  Shladover70–72 
showed both in simulations and experiments that

and this is a quantification of the benefit of addi-
tional connectivity.

For  example,  using  the  earlier  simulation 
setup  with τ0 = 0.5  s,  we  can  achieve  string  sta-
bility  even  with  a  time  headway  of  0.7  s,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  10.  However,  if  the  time  headway 
does  not  meet  the  minimum  requirements  of 
2τ0
1+ka = 0.67  s,  stability  may  not  be  achieved  (as 
shown  in  Fig.  11,  with  time  headway  of  0.4  s). 
Here, ka was chosen to be 0.5.

The  usage  of  preceding  vehicle’s  acceleration 
in  ACC  systems  was  initially  christened  Semi-
autonomous  Adaptive  Cruise  Control  and  was 
first considered in Ref.76 However, the result here 
seemed to suggest that the lower bound for time 
headway can be made arbitrarily small by the use 
of acceleration feedback of the controlled vehicle, 
that is

ui = −k1 ¨xi + ka ¨xi−1 − kv(˙xi − ˙xi−1)
− kp(xi − xi−1 + L0 + h˙xi).

or equivalently:

h ≥

.

Since there is no restriction on k1 other than the 
restrictions  for  stability,  k1 ≥ 0  could  be  cho-
sen  to  arbitrarily  reduce  the  bound.  However, 
this  seems  to  contradict  what  was  established 
in  Refs.18,  29,  55  Clearly,  when  h = 0 ,  the  desired 
following  distance  does  not  vary  with  vehicle’s 
speed; in this case, it is a constant spacing policy. 
In  this  case,  semi-autonomous  control  does  not 
lead to string stability. As h → 0 , this case should 
lead to the same conclusion. This can be inferred 
if a higher order perturbation was to be used or 
a  delay  (or  even  possibly,  a  lag)  included  in  the 
measurement  and  communication  of  preceding 
vehicle’s  acceleration.  Such  a  perturbed  model 
will limit the values of k1 (and consequently, ka ) 
and  subsequently,  limit  h.  A  plausible  argument 
against the use of controlled vehicle’s acceleration 
feedback  is  as  follows:  For  a  non-zero  but  small 
delay,  ∆ >0  ,  in  the  acceleration  measurement, 
one  obtains  a  quasi-polynomial  (in  the  denomi-
nator of Hp(s) ) as:
τ s3 + (1 + k1e−s∆)s2 + (kv + hkp)s + kp.
Stability when ∆ = 0 requires all the coefficients 
of the above quasi-polynomial to be of the same 
sign and

τ kp > (1 + k1)(kv + hkp),

thereby limiting k1 . Moreover, from pages 104 to 
106 of Ref.77, instability sets in if k1 /∈ [− 1, 1] and 
can be even smaller for string instability. This can 
be a potential drawback in the scheme adopted by 
Bian et al.78 as acceleration of the controlled vehi-
cle is fed back.

is 2τ0 . It is shown in Ref.79 that h ≥ 2τ0
 in this 
1+pka
case,  using  a  deterministic  equivalent  of  the  sto-
chastic system.

For example, even if a platoon with τ0 = 0.5 s 
and ka = 0.5 were to implement a time headway 
of  0.7 s > ( 2τ0
) ,  the  platoon  is  observed  to  be 
1+ka
unstable if packets are only received with a prob-
ability  of  0.5  (see  Fig.  12).  However,  if  the  time 
headway is readjusted to account for the expected 
packet  reception  rate  (in  this  case,  p = 0.5  and 
the  minimum  2τ0
= 0.8 ),  then  string  stability 
1+pka
can be regained, as shown in Fig. 13, with a time 
headway of 0.9 s.

4.3   Traffic Heterogeneity
Heterogeneity in vehicle strings has recently been 
gaining a significant attention.80–85 Vehicle model 
represented by (7) or (8) makes any collection of 
structurally  heterogeneous  vehicles  to  obey  the 
identical  dynamics  for  analyzing  vehicle  motion 
under  nominal  maneuvers  via  feedback  lineari-
zation.  Consumers  are  usually  given  a  choice  of 
time headway from a small but discrete set (typi-
cally  ranging  from  0.5  to  2  s).  If  the  vehicles  are 
made  by  the  same  manufacturer  and  are  of  the 
same make, a basic problem to be understood is: 
how does heterogeneity in the choice of headway 
settings affects propagation of errors?

The  distinguishing  feature  of  the  work  in 
Ref.86  is  in  its  consideration  of  heterogeneity  of 
traffic  arising  from  drivers  adopting  different 
time headway even if they drive identical vehicles. 
The main result of this paper is that if there is a 
way  to  organize  vehicles  in  a  string,  so  that  the 
time headway employed by vehicles in the string 
is  monotonically  decreasing,  then  string  stability 
can  be  guaranteed.  Simulation  of  results  is  also 
presented for cases where the ordering is different 
from this case.

In this case, it is sufficient that �rH(jw)�∞ = 1 for 
guaranteeing  string  stability;  by  letting  ¯h = r+1

Ka = rka, Kv = rkv, Kp = rkp , one can exploit the 
headway bound for CACC to derive a bound for

 case: rka ∈ [0, 1] and

.

In  this  case,  it  is  clear  that  the  bound  for  h 
decreases with r in the presence of ideal commu-
nication  of  information  of  preceding  vehicles  in 
the  string.  This  benefit  of  connectivity  was  first 
reported  by  Darbha,  Konduri,  and  Pagilla,73,  74 
and  later,  extensions  of  this  result  appeared  in 
Ref.78  An  additional  problem  with  Ref.78  is  that 
the  reduction  in  headway  is  intimately  tied  to 
the  value  of  ka  = 0 ;  if  controlled  vehicle’s  accel-
eration may not be fed back, this guarantee fades 
away.

4.2.4   CACC with Imperfect Communication
A natural question that arises concerns how small 
the time headway can be when the communicated 
information is received in a distorted manner or 
not at all. If one were to model packet reception as 
a Bernoulli process with a packet reception prob-
ability  of  p,  then  in  the  extreme  limits  of  p = 1 , 
we have a lower bound for time headway of  2τ0
, 
1+ka
and when  p = 0 , the corresponding lower bound

5   Traffic Modeling with CACC
Traffic dynamics, when specified at the granular-
ity  of  each  vehicle,  constitutes  microscopic  traf-
fic  models  (or  car-following  models).  As  can  be 
seen  in  a  traffic  consisting  of  CAVs,  the  micro-
scopic  traffic  dynamics  can  be  engineered  and  it 
will influence the macroscopic behavior of traffic. 
A  natural  question  arises  as  to  how  the  micro-
scopic dynamics of traffic affects its macroscopic 
description? This question is important to under-
stand the shift/change in traffic dynamics due to 
the  deployment  of  CAVs  and  take  appropriate 
traffic management actions. The question of rela-
tionship  between  macroscopic  and  microscopic 
descriptions  of  traffic  was  first  broached  for 
manually  driven  traffic  in  Gazis,  Hermann,  and 
Potts;48  essentially,  they  fit  a  non-linear  spacing 
policy  for  the  microscopic  models  that  matches 
the  macroscopic  “steady-state”  observations  in 
the  form  of  a  Fundamental  Traffic  Characteris-
tic  (FTC);  since  spacing  policy  is  a  design  vari-
able, Darbha and Rajagopal50 related the spacing 
policy design with achievable FTC and posed an 
inverse  problem  of  specifying  the  spacing  policy 
to  suit  traffic  flow  specifications  in  the  steady 
state.  However,  understanding  the  dynamics  of 
traffic transients requires one to focus on the phi-
losophy of modeling the flow of traffic.

The current traffic flow models even for CAVs 
are  based  on  treating  traffic  as  a  continuum;  usu-
ally, some modifications of the Navier–Stokes equa-
tion87, 88 or Maxwell–Boltzmann equations89, 90 are 
used to describe the macroscopic behavior of traf-
fic. The principal objections to using these models 
are as follows:91

(i)  Traffic  does  not  consist  of  sufficiently 
large number of vehicles to be treated as a 
continuum.

(ii)  Treating the traffic as a continuum seems to 
cause a problem with propagation of distur-
bances  in  the  wrong  direction,  i.e.,  if  vehi-
cles in a section of a highway stop due to an 
accident or any other event, the velocities of 
both upstream and downstream sections get 
affected;  this  is  counter  to  our  observation 
with regard to the flow of traffic.

(iii)  It is not clear why one should model CAVs 
or  manually  driven  vehicles  as  a  Navier–
Stokes fluid or, for that matter, models that 
generalize 
Lighthill–Whitham–Richards 
(LWR)  models87,  88  or  the  Maxwell–Boltz-
mann’s  model  based  on  kinetic  theory  of 
gases.

Preliminary  results  from  Ankem86  (a  sample 
of it is shown in Fig. 14) on a heterogeneous col-
lection  of  CAVs  (consisting  of  CAVs  equipped 
with ACC  and  others  with  CACC  and  employing 
different values of time headway) seem to suggest 
that attenuation of spacing errors is possible if the 
time  headways  form  a  monotonically  decreasing 
sequence  in  the  string  and  the  worst-case  ampli-
fication  occurs  if  the  time  headway  employed  by 
vehicles forms a monotonically increasing sequence. 
Since  the  time  headway  values  are  chosen  from  a 
finite  and  bounded  set,  maximum  spacing  errors 
geometrically  attenuate  spatially  at  the  tail  of  the 
string  if  the  size  of  the  string  is  sufficiently  large. 
Hence,  it  seems  sufficient  to  consider  strings  of 
small  size  (of  the  same  order  as  the  number  of 
headway settings) to find if the order of vehicles in 
the strings contributes to a large spacing error.

At  every  stage  of  deployment  of  CAVs,  one 
must  contend  with  heterogeneity  arising  from 
vehicles  of  the  same  make  but  of  different  func-
tionality.  For  example,  vehicles  equipped  with 
ACC systems versus those equipped with CACC
+
systems. This is a first step towards understanding 
the more complicated mixed traffic consisting of 
human driven vehicles and CAVs.

A Review of Automatic Vehicle Following Systems1 3 
 
(iv) 

It is not clear how changes in the underly-
ing information flow graph and associated 
control  laws  for  CAVs  get  reflected  in  the 
macroscopic  description  of  traffic  consist-
ing of CAVs.

In Ref.91, Darbha and Rajagopal proposed a traf-
fic model to overcome these limitations; the idea 
of this model is to select representative vehicles in 
a section and use their vehicle following laws as a 
representative for the evolution equations of traf-
fic  speed  in  the  section;  this  serves  as  an  analog 
of the balance of linear momentum in fluid-type 
models  while  directly  reflecting  the  underlying 
automatic  vehicle  following  behavior.  As  far  as 
the accumulation of vehicles in a section is con-
cerned,  it  is  just  the  balance  law  for  mass  and  is 
based on the number of vehicles of a representa-
tive type entering and leaving the section. Clearly, 
if  the  number  of  vehicles  in  a  section  increases, 
the  corresponding  average  following  decreases 
and it is reflected in an equation for average fol-
lowing  distance  on  which  the  vehicle  following 
behavior is based. This model seems to overcome 
the  above-mentioned  limitations  and  seems  to 
be  able  to  accommodate  heterogeneity  in  traffic 
unlike the continuum-based models.

6   Traffic Safety
Metrizing traffic safety is important for assessing 
the  safety  benefits  of  CAVs;  however,  the  task  of 
metrizing traffic safety is difficult and can depend 
on  the  sequence  of  events  under  consideration. 
An  emergency  braking  situation  is  relevant  for 
AVFS in assessing safety metrics such as the prob-
ability, expected number, and severity of rear-end 
collisions  in  a  string  of  vehicles  equipped  with 
ACC/CACC
  systems.  These  metrics  can  help 
one to compare the safety benefits of connectivity 
and different control laws.

+

It is intuitive that if all vehicles travel initially at 
the same velocity and brake at the same decelera-
tion at the same time, there will not be any colli-
sion.  This  corresponds  to  the  case  when  vehicles 
coordinate  their  braking  either  through  commu-
nication and coordination or via vehicle following 
control laws. In the former case, every vehicle must 
be  cognizant  of  its  maximum  deceleration  and 
communicate this information to the lead vehicle, 
so that it brakes at the least value of the maximum 
deceleration  of  all  vehicles  in  the  string.  In  the 
latter  case,  the  vehicle  following  control  laws  dic-
tates how a vehicle must brake based on the avail-
able information. In both cases, if the commanded 
deceleration  is  within  the  maximum  deceleration 

of all vehicles, then no collisions can occur if string 
stability  is  guaranteed  and  the  stand-still  separa-
tion  is  adequate.  In  the  event  that  commanded 
deceleration  exceeds  the  maximum  deceleration 
of some vehicle in the string, string stability guar-
antees do not hold; heterogeneity in their deceler-
ating  capability  will  have  a  significant  bearing  on 
safety in an emergency braking situation.86, 92

In  the  Emergency  Braking  (EB)  situation,  all 
vehicles  in  a  string  have  the  same  initial  velocity 
but  different  decelerating  capability.  The  maxi-
mum  achievable  deceleration  can  be  different 
owing to a variety of factors such as the wear and 
tear of tires, condition of the road, and the make of 
vehicles.  It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  maxi-
mum  deceleration  of  every  vehicle  in  the  string  is 
an  independent  random  variable  drawn  from  a 
known  probability  distribution.  When  a  vehicle 
is  commanded  a  deceleration  in  accordance  with 
the control law, the commanded deceleration may 
not be realizable, because it may exceed the maxi-
mum  deceleration  of  the  vehicle.  In  such  a  case, 
the “effective” deceleration is the minimum of the 
commanded and maximum values of deceleration, 
and is a random variable. With a perfect coordina-
tion scheme alluded to earlier, the “effective” decel-
eration of all vehicles is the same, and hence, there 
is no variance in effective deceleration of the vehi-
cles in a string. In this case, the benefit of coordina-
tion in this scenario is clear. Qualitatively, it is clear 
that  if  the  variance  of  the  probability  distribution 
of  “effective”  braking  is  small,  the  corresponding 
safety quantities such as the probability of a colli-
sion,  the  expected  number  of  collisions,  and  the 
expected  relative  velocity  at  impact  will  be  small. 
AVFS reduces this variance in braking through the 
vehicle following control laws as evidenced in Ref.92
Another issue arises in the computation of met-
rics—that of the mechanics of collision. Consider 
a  pileup  where  collisions  between  some  vehicles 
cause collisions between other pairs of vehicles in 
a platoon, collisions that would not have otherwise 
happened.  One  can,  therefore,  think  of  primary 
and  secondary  collisions,  with  primary  collisions 
being the antecedents and the secondary collisions 
being the consequents. If one is to deal with colli-
sions, one must take into account both the primary 
and  the  secondary  collisions;  the  occurrence  of 
secondary collisions depends on the mechanics of 
the  primary  collisions.  Since  secondary  collisions 
can be sensitive to the model of a collision, Darbha 
and Choi92, 93 introduced the concept of a violation 
in a string to simplify the analysis of collisions as 
follows: a violation occurs in a platoon if one can 
find  a  successive  pair  of  vehicles  where  the  effec-
tive deceleration of the following vehicle is smaller

to  determine 

for  the  purposes  of  simplicity,  initial  spac-
ing  and  velocity  errors  may  be  assumed  to  be 
vi(0) = v0, xi(0) − xi−1(0) = hwv0 + L0 , 
zero: 
where  v0, L0  are  deterministic.  The 
funda-
mental  problem  here 
the 
statistics  (mean  and  variance,  if  not  the  prob-
ability  distribution  at  every  sample  time  k) 
for  the  spacing  errors,  velocities,  and  effective  
deceleration  of  vehicles, 
respectively,  given  
by  ǫi(k)(:= xi(k) − xi−1(k) + L0), vi(k), ui(k) 
for  i = 1, 2, . . . , N .  Clearly,  mean  and  variance 
indicate the spread of the spacing; the associated 
probability  distributions  can,  indeed,  be  com-
puted  either  analytically  or  computationally  via 
sampling  procedures.  An  example  of  the  prob-
ability  distribution  for  maximum  deceleration  is 
provided  in  Fig.  15.  One  can  also  subsequently 
calculate the probability of a violation, i.e., prob-
ability  that  ǫi(k) <0   for  every  k  and  the  cor-
responding  values  of  the  relative  velocity.  This 
problem  formulation  is  generic  and  can  easily 
be modified to accommodate parasitic dynamics 
or  delays  in  communication  through  changes  in 
model  given  by  Eq.  (11)  or  changes  in  the  vehi-
cle following law given in Eqs. (12) and (13). This 
problem  is  challenging  to  solve  due  to  the  pres-
ence  of  the  limits  on  the  maximum  acceleration 
values (Eq. 13). 

An important feature of the proposed formu-
lation is that it allows for quantifying the benefits 
of  additional  information  while  accounting  for 
heterogeneity  in  traffic.  Specifically,  one  can  aim 
to  understand  the  enhancement  in  safety  due  to 
the  use  of  preceding  vehicle’s  acceleration  in  a 
CACC  (as  against  an  ACC)  system.  To  illustrate 
further, the model was implemented for two fol-
lowing  vehicles  in  a  three-vehicle  string  using 
a  brute  force  approach.  The  variance  in  the  dis-
tance  of  the  two  following  vehicles  is  shown  in 
Fig. 16. The curves with labels ‘ACC1’ and ‘ACC2’ 
correspond to the first and second following vehi-
cles,  each  of  them  obeying  an  ACC  control  law; 
the  corresponding  curves  for  following  vehicles 
obeying  CACC  are  shown  with  labels  ‘CACC1’ 
and ‘CACC2’. Clearly, the plots show the value of 
communication in terms of reducing the variance 
of  following  distance  for  this  simple  example.  A 
similar trend was observed for spacing errors and 
control  inputs  in  larger  vehicle  platoons,  imply-
ing  that  accidents,  if  ever  they  happen,  will  be 
restricted to a few vehicles at the head of the pla-
toon and within a certain time window after the 
initiation  of  emergency  braking.  This  plot  fur-
ther corroborates the safety benefit of connectiv-
ity  associated  with  CACC  system  vis-a-vis  ACC 
system.

than that of its predecessor. Clearly, the probability 
of  a  violation  and  the  expected  number  of  viola-
tions in a platoon will have a bearing on the prob-
ability  (primary  or  secondary)  and  the  expected 
number  of  collisions,  respectively.  Darbha  and 
Choi92  corroborated  the  computational  benefits 
of using violation as a proxy for collision; they first 
computed the safety metrics computed via Monte 
Carlo  simulations  when  vehicles  employ  constant 
spacing  policy  and  the  control  law  in  Ref.18;  they 
employed  a  simple  model  of  collision  involving 
coefficient of restitution. Darbha and Choi92 then 
used  a  Markov  Chain  approach  to  analytically 
compute  the  probability  of  a  violation,  expected 
number of violations, and expected relative veloc-
ity  when  a  violation  occurs.  The  analytical  com-
putational  results  seem  to  correlate  well  with  the 
Monte Carlo simulation results for different values 
of coefficients of restitution.

From  the  traffic  safety  viewpoint  of  CACC
+
systems,  the  probability  distribution  of  effective 
deceleration of each of the vehicles, and their rel-
ative spacing and velocity are critical.

For  the  purposes  of  illustration,  consider 
the  following  discretized  model  of  the  simplified 
dynamics of the ith vehicle in a string of N vehi-
 system and assuming a 
cles employing a CACC
+
control sample time of T seconds for every vehicle:

(cid:31)

(cid:31)

where  xi(k), vi(k), and ui(k) are, respectively, the 
position, velocity, and control input of the vehicle 
at time t = kT . For the Emergency Braking (EB) 
Scenario  corresponding  to  a  string  of  CACC
+
vehicles,  the  lead  vehicle  brakes  at  its  maximum 
deceleration,  while  the  following  vehicles  obey 
CACC
  that  employs  a  constant-time  headway 
of hw s. As long as the commanded deceleration is 
within the braking limit, the effective deceleration 
is the same as the commanded deceleration; oth-
erwise, the vehicle brakes at its maximum decel-
eration (braking limit, Di ). This is reflected in the 
following  equations  where  the  EB  is  on  the  first 
vehicle:

+

u1(k) = −D 1,

ucom,i(k) = −k p[xi(k) − xi−1(k) + hwvi(k) + L0]

− kv[vi(k) − vi−1(k)] + kaui−1(k),

ui = max{ucom,i, −Di},

for all k ≥ 0 , such that vi(k) >0 .

While  the  formulation  provided  in  Ref.93 
allows  for  initial  conditions  to  be  stochastic,

7   Conclusion
In this review article, we focused on central issues 
concerning  the  design  of  automatic  vehicle  fol-
lowing—vehicle  models  for  AVFS,  string  stable 
control  design,  and  its  robustness  to  singular 
perturbations;  we  further  reviewed  the  issues 
for traffic modeling and safety with AVFS. While 
connectivity  has  the  potential  to  bring  about 
enhancements  in  traffic  safety  and  mobility,  its 
exploitation  requires  a  serious  consideration. 
As  can  be  seen  from  the  article,  the  models  for 
assessing the safety and mobility benefits of con-
nectivity are in their infancy.
